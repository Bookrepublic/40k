It remains to be seen whether the e-book will become the product the publishing industry needs in order to maintain a business model that's very old and crumbling. But e-publishing is inherently disruptive and, with the happy collusion of readers, who love the low price and convenience of the download, authors who take control of their own e-publishing will rock the world.

The time when text will free itself from the confines of books, book length, book genres and all the other requirements of publishing that have been dictated more by manufacturing necessities or distribution needs, and less by the imperatives of form or the desires of readers.

Rather than isolated events, innovation is becoming a norm of everyday life and, in many cases, a necessity for survival in the age of the competition from millions of jostling content creators. A generation raised with the exhortation to "think outside the box" often does, with amazing results. And the book publishing industry, long an enemy of innovation in anything other than cost-savings, will need to turn into an innovation-driven business to survive.
