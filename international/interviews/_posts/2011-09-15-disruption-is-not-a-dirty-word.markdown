**Money quote**

"The large publishers will tell you that people are quite happy to pay $9.99 or even $14.99 for John Grisham’s latest. But these readers are not attached to the price point or the publisher, the brand they are loyal to is the author.
If John Grisham suddenly decided to self-publish, his readers wouldn’t abandon him because he was shorn of his publisher’s logo, or priced at $4.99. In fact, I would bet anything that his sales would rise."
