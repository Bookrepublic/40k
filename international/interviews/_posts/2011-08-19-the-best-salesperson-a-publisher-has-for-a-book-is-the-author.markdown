![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/indieway.jpg) Bob Mayer: "For many years I wondered why no traditional publisher bought my latest manuscript, not only for the manuscript, but with the thought of breaking that book out and then acquiring my extensive backlist**.** I always felt like I was sitting on a gold mine, but not a single publisher saw it that way—in fact they viewed it quite the opposite way. I understand the problem was shelf space, but now that’s no longer an issue. And I have the numbers to prove it. Even though shelf space was an issue, it always felt like publishers belonged in gambler’s anonymous rather than in business. They were always betting on throwing one hundred new books against the wall, hoping one won the lottery. There was little sense of nurturing an author’s career or looking to the future with a long-term commitment.

Oh yes. The numbers. I have 11 of the top 100 science fiction sellers on Amazon (2 in top 10). From backlist. I have 11 of the top 50 titles in War on Amazon. 10 are backlist, one is a new title, [Chasing The Ghost](http://whodareswinspublishing.com/). I have twelve titles in the top 1,000 on Kindle. I have a title in the top 50 on Nook, Area 51. I have five series I’ll be moving into the future with new titles. I still have 6 backlist titles to upload, including my Psychic Warrior series and Shadow Warrior series."

**Money quote**

"The best salesperson a publisher has for a book is the author. Work with them. Make it worth their time. I actually think the advance model might be antiquated and a profit sharing model could work much better, if the author gets a bigger slice of the pie for motivation but also shares the cost of failure (a blog post about this later). I sell more in one day in eBook than Random House managed to do in six months with the same books."
