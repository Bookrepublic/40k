![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/IndieWay2.jpg)_ Bob Mayer, "Fear is the downfall of publishing"_

"As a former Infantryman and Green Beret, I learned a lot about fear. Now I’m seeing it consuming publishing and authors. I’m going to cut to the chase here. I did a booksigning this past weekend and was seated next to a traditionally published author who was giving away free copies of his mass-market paperbacks. He’s selling well, probably has a decent contract with his publisher for two or three more books (coming out in two or three years…). But. He kept glancing at my POD trade paperbacks and also noticed how much I really didn’t care if I sold any of my print books.

**Money quote**

"Frankly, I don’t think anyone in NY Publishing really understands the big picture of ebook publishing from writer to reader. I keep seeing panels at conferences made up of “experts” on digital publishing, but rarely are these people making their living off selling their own books through digital publishing, so I submit they are observers, not experts.  That doesn’t mean their opinion isn’t valid, it just means it isn’t completely solid. I had an editor from Random House tell me they were chasing the technology to see where it would lead—such a statement staggers me as the primary rule of combat is to act, not react."
