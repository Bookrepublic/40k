Nicola Morgan: «I believe that if you can say yes to all of these, you give  yourself  more chance of being published.
Unfortunately, I can't guarantee that  doing all of them will get  you published, because that depends on what you have written, how well  you have written it and whether a publisher believes he can make a  success of it. And magic fairy dust.» [Read more](http://helpineedapublisher.blogspot.com/2011/01/checklist-for-getting-published.html).

**1.  WRITING. THINKING OUT OF THE BOX
**

**# Explore how the reading experience works. **
What is it that transforms a page full of words into an experience that moves us and leaves us changed?

# **Our brains naturally frame events as stories.
**Stories are efficient summaries of reality, but that isn't all they are.  Stories have an arc, they put constraints on the future - when you've  heard the first half there are some things which are more likely in the  second, and some less. I'm sure our minds use stories because they  describe the way the world is AND because they say something about how  the world could or will be. [Read more](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=2176).

**Fascinating stuff.  Livia suggests that writers can use information  about brain regions as a source of ideas for details to include in their  narratives. Are you using all five senses? What about movement? Are  your characters complex enough for the reader to infer motivations,  thoughts, and feelings from their actions?

**# Read eBooks right on your computer**
While the pros of having a dedicated eReader are numerous, the reality  is that you could dip your toes into the eBook market without having to  shell out a lot of money for a fancy new device.  I point this out  because, if you're like me, you like to try things out before spending  gobs of money.  I wasn't sure I would like reading on a screen, so I  wanted to take a sort of 'test drive' first and that's when I came  across ways that you could read eBooks on your existing equipment.

[![Selling Stories Successfully](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/selling-brown_ok_t.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Selling-Stories-Successfully-ebook/dp/B004IWQVEK/)# **Any fool can write a novel but it takes real genius to sell it
**Picture the scene. You’re a struggling writer. You’ve written the most incredible story. You’ve come up with a yarn that’s Twilight times ten, a novel that makes Larsson’s Millennium Trilogy look so last century.
There’s only one problem. It’s a major problem, however. You’ve got to sell the thing. You have to persuade people to buy it, both literally and metaphorically.
You’ve woken up to the fact that storytelling and storyselling are two completely different things.

**# How To Use Facebook Advertising To Market Your Book**
Joanna Penn: «Generally, I’m a fan of free marketing like blogging, social networking, podcasting and video creation. All these things take time but are free or very cheap. But sometimes, there is a place for paid advertising, especially  around the time of a book launch and I’ll be using Facebook for the Pentecost launch.» [Read more](http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2011/01/23/how-to-use-facebook-advertising-to-market-your-book/).
