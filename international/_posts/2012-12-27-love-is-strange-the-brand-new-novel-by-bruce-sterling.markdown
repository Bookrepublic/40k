**THE STORY**

They're futurists in love. They don't believe in romantic happy endings.

Farfalla Corrado is a globetrotting Italian witch, trained in Brazilian voodoo. Farfalla can tell real fortunes, see real ghosts and speak real curses. Farfalla doesn't just know the future – she can feel in in the dark, twisted depths of her heart.

Gavin Tremaine is a high-tech Seattle venture capitalist. He can forecast the future, spot its trends, and invest in its business models. Gavin has a big future ahead of him – unfortunately, Gavin knows what that big future holds for the little people.

When their worlds collide, history itself begins to crumble. They already know how this love story is bound to end – and it's not what the other expects.

**Length:** about 137.000 words

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

“My premonitions are real. They are ‘real’ like the future is real. Because the future is never ‘really real.’ The future hasn’t happened yet, and the past is gone forever. The ghosts of the past and the visions of the future are the same for me.”

“I get that. You’re outside temporality. You’re beyond the narrative.”

“Yes. The narrative,that’s the word. I am the Cassandra of the narrative.”

“I’m the same way, Farfalla. Well, in my own way — but in my own narrative, I’m the same way.”

“Gavin, how did it happen to you?”

“Oh, it happened to me, all right... Once, I went to this little meeting of Microsoft kids. Like, this high-school trip thing, but it was very exclusive. We met the world’s greatest Futurist there. Dr Gustav Y. Svante. Nobody knows who he is. That’s why he’s the world’s greatest Futurist. He told us... He said that the future was already here, but nobody listens to the future. The future is all around us, but we don’t see the future yet. We don’t hear it or see it, so we can’t tell it.”
