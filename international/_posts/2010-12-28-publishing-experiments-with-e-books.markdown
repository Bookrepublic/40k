  «So I decided to experiment. In October, I put my out-of-print mainstream novel Goldfish Dreams up for sale on B&N; and Amazon as a $2.99, DRM-free e-book. My friend Steven Saus did the conversion for me. (This is not an instant or easy process; both Amazon and B&N; have guidelines for their preferred formats.)
  
  

[...]
  
  

After roughly two months, I've sold 33 books through Amazon and 4 through B&N;, for about $75 in royalties. Hardly the thousands certain voices led me to expect. By comparison, in the past eight weeks, Bookscan tells me that my backlist with DAW has sold 2200 books, an average of 370 per book. Even the book that came out more than four years ago sold about 280 copies. Those royalties come to more than $1000.»
