**CHEAPEST E-BOOKS UPEND THE CHARTS  
99-CENT TITLES FROM UNKNOWN AUTHORS PUT NEW PRESSURE ON BIG PUBLISHERS**

"As digital sales surge, publishers are casting a worried eye towards the previously scorned self-published market. Unlike five years ago, when self-published writers rarely saw their works on the same shelf as the industry's biggest names, the low cost of digital publishing, coupled with Twitter and other social-networking tools, has enabled previously unknown writers to make a splash."

**ON THE GATHERING STORM OF INDIE PUBLISHING WITH AUTHOR JASON MCINTYRE**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Jason_McIntyre_EZ-e1304176854743.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=8145)"It’s no secret that independent (indie) publishing is hot these days, particularly because of the rise of ebooks. We were curious about the success of an indie author who, just under a year into publishing his first ebook, has had more than 33,000 downloads of his work. Jason McIntyre, author of several stories and books including  On the Gathering Storm and the hot new novel Thalo Blue sits down with us for a brief interview about what he does, how he got started and his strategy for reaching an audience."

**HOW WRITERS BUILD THE BRAND**

"In this era when most writers are expected to do everything but run the printing presses, self-promotion is so accepted that we hardly give it a second thought. And yet, whenever I have a new book about to come out, I have to shake the unpleasant sensation that there is something unseemly about my own clamor for attention. Peddling my work like a Viagra salesman still feels at odds with the high calling of literature. In such moments of doubt, I look to history for reassurance. It’s always comforting to be reminded that literary whoring — I mean, self-marketing — has been practiced by the greats."

**IPAD USERS MAY NOT BECOME BOOK READERS, REPORT FINDS**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/ipadwithjobs-e1304176990144.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=8138)"Senior analyst and author of the report Michael Norris said: «A lot of  people equate the sale of a new sale gadget with the creation of a new  reader, and it just doesn't happen. In both the offline and online  world, there are a lot of independent factors and distractions that will  keep a person from discovering and enjoying a book.»"

**ONE IN 4 AMERICANS READ EBOOKS**

"Some of the results include the fact that fiction continues to dominate  downloads with SF, romance, and literary fiction each accounting for 20%  of the market. [...] But there’s one detail that didn’t quite make it into the report, and I  think it’s important.The survey group covered 3 thousand people, and  this report is drawn from the responses of the 750 who own an eReader or  eBook. So 1 in 4 respondents are into eBooks. This would suggest that  the adoption rate for eBooks in the US is about 25%."

**SF SIGNAL: HOW TO START READING SCIENCE FICTION, PART 4: SHORT STORIES**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/lead_art_415-191x300.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=8152)"Admit it, sometimes you like to snack between meals. There's  something satisfying about sneaking a small treat separate from larger  feasts. Guess what? The same holds true for reading. In the mood for a  quick fix? Take a bite of short fiction!  
Science fiction and fantasy readers could easily subsist on short  fiction alone if they so desired. With so many sources of good short  fiction available, it's hard _not_ to snack between meals."

**HOW WE SAW OUR FUTURE IN THE PAST: THE BRITISH LIBRARY'S HISTORY OF SCIENCE FICTION**

"Nothing provokes nostalgia like the projected futures from our past. There they are, recorded in the pages of Amazing Stories and on strips of celluloid. Jet-pack and warp drive, digital immortality and interstellar travel: science fiction dreams that remind us what we wanted to be when we grew up. Nightmares, too, that linger on into the present and its imagined posterity. The uncanniness of aliens, clones and robots; the implacable mechanisms of surveillance states; the revenge of mutated organisms and wrecked ecosystems."
