**KINDLE-PROOF YOUR BOOK IN SEVEN EASY STEPS!**

![](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0394752848.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg) To “sell out,” you first have to sell, and in committing to the ideal of the “beautiful” book, I had pretty much guaranteed that this particular project would remain unsullied by commerce.   
Now, in honor of the future that never was, the durable pigments of the almost obsolete, I offer you the following trade secrets to fellow writers.   
The availability for the Kindle of some of the titles mentioned below points to the difficulty of the task; nonetheless, here are: Seven Ways to Kindle-proof Your Book

**10 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SELF-PUBLISHING**

**SELF-PUBLISHING: ALL THE COOL KIDS ARE DOING IT**

Self-publishing, that is. Or at least, it can seem so. There are the breakthrough success stories at one end of the spectrum, bitter tales of sales disappointment at the other, and between the two, a generous smattering of testimonials from indie authors who aren't earning enough to quit their day jobs yet but are covering the rent or groceries each month with proceeds from their book sales. Suddenly, if you're not releasing a Kindle or Nook edition at the minimum, you feel like you're missing out on a huge opportunity. The pressure to rush to market is great, but you must resist it until both you and your book are truly ready for prime time.

**25 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT STORYTELLING **

![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4043/5128850888_d1c7e85cd0.jpg)Outside the air we breathe and the blood in our bodies, the one thing that connects us modern humans today with the shamans and emperors and serfs and alien astronauts of our past is a heritage — a _lineage_ — of stories. Stories move the world at the same time they explain our place in it. They help us understand ourselves and those near to us. Never treat a story as a shallow, wan little thing. A good story is as powerful as the bullet fired from an assassin’s gun.

**THE FUTURE OF BOOKSELLING**

Booksellers need to realize that Amazon is not their competition; convenience is.  Retail booksellers need to provide higher fidelity experiences for their customers and answer the question: "What can I do better?" Or put another way: the book is the start, and not the end to the experience customers want to have.

**WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TALKING ABOUT GENRE**

The little lobe of my brain that serves as a Geiger counter for detecting blog posts theorizing about genre has been ticking with ever-increasing rapidity these days. It’s ticking so fast that it has crossed the threshold that unlocks another lobe of my brain, a top-secret lobe that contains a sealed black folder labeled.
