**THE STORY**

A man wearing a hat is shot. He staggers out of the rain into the PI’s office and dies in a gurgle of blood and German words. Just as things couldn’t get worse, the corpse turns into a werewolf. Our Gumshoe, somewhat of a www expert, has trouble identifying his pack. It’s going to take a visit to the Search Engine to crack the mystery. But at what cost? Along with more bullets comes the killer. She needs his help. He needs her like a hole in the head. But they go way back and our sappy PI finds himself sucked into a vortex of time, titans and trouble.

**THE STRING CITY MYSTERIES**

"A hard-boiled private investigator with a talent for twisting dimensions … a beautiful dame … a changeling baby made of wood … the perfect ingredients for the first of my String City Mysteries, a series of fantasy noir detective romps due to be published by 40k Books throughout 2012.

I wrote _The Wooden Baby_ immediately after devouring a Dashiell Hammett anthology. I’m not the first to mix up the fantasy and detective genres, but it’s such a juicy collision I can’t resist it. Later stories in the series explore the strange city where my nameless gumshoe lives, but this first adventure just places him in an anonymous office in the middle of, apparently, nowhere.

_The Wooden Baby_ by Graham Edwards was first published in the April 2005 edition of [Realms of Fantasy](http://www.rofmag.com/)."

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

"Knowing I was safe, I knelt down beside my visitor. The carpet he’d buried his face in was now soaked in blood as well as rainwater. Each time he breathed out he made little red bubbles. He made three more bubbles before giving up for good.  
Great. Now I had a corpse on my hands, my office was a crime scene and I had to get my carpet cleaned – again.  
And things just kept getting better."
