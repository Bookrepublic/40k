  «Gifting a digital book should be the start of a grand conversation.
  
  

Why gift? We gift because we've found something uniquely aligned with and yet unknown to the recipient. Something that will add positive value to their life. And there's a selfish motive - particularly with a book - that we really want to discuss the gift with that person. To give a gift is to initiate a narrative.
  
  

The best gifts are often unexpected. That beautiful notebook out of the blue. The surprise thank you present. Just imagine how much fun it would be to quietly gift books onto your friends' Kindles or iPads. How, if properly engineered, that gifting would be the start of a shared conversation around that book.»
