**COMMODITY PUBLISHING, SELF-PUBLISHING, AND THE FUTURE OF FICTION**

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/books.jpeg) "If commodity publishing is here to stay, I can only see its future in the realm of genre fiction, because this is the area where I see sufficient reader demand to drive the kind of volume that leads to a living wage. It’s also the only area where I see authors without qualms about quality, or without any hesitation to produce as much material as possible, with the only limitation the amount of time you can keep your butt in the chair writing."

**JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING HAS VALUE DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS A PRICE**

"If every shred needs to be accounted for and paid for, then the harvest won't happen. Paying for every link you make, or every link you count, or every document you analyse is a losing game. Forget payment: the process of figuring out who to pay and how much is owed would totally swamp the expected return from whatever it is you're planning on making out of all those unloved scraps.

In other words, if all latent value from our activity has a price-tag attached to it, it won't get us all paid – instead, it will just stop other people from making cool, useful, interesting and valuable things out of our waste-product."

**PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE MERGER BEGINS A NEW CHAPTER FOR PUBLISHING**

"Publishing brands are starting to emerge as consumer brands, not in all places, but in some. And perhaps the most interesting question for the new Random Penguin merger is what they do decide to do with Penguin as a consumer brand that is not even constrained by its own publishing, but orientated to the interests of its readers more generally. In other words, can it become a home for discovery of excellent reading as well as a great publisher?"

**THE E-READER REVOLUTION: OVER JUST AS IT HAS BEGUN?**

"The real innovation in e-readers has been giving consumers a convenient way to buy books, wirelessly, without even having to use their computers," says Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester Research analyst. "Giving consumers a digital storefront right in their hands, that's what really made e-readers a phenomenon."

**BACK TO THE FUTURE OF DIGITAL PUBLISHING**

"Remember 1993?

Don’t worry – this isn’t one of those shows on VH1 where washed-up pseudo-celebrities make flippant remarks about other washed-up celebrities who were famous in 1993. It’s a real look back at the past: what agents thought about digital publishing way back when. Despite what your opinion about agents’ relationships with ebooks today, in 1993 they were well-informed and perhaps ahead of the curve."
