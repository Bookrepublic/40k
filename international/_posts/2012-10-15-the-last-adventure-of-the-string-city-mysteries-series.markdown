Raymond and Leonora Lanchester receive free tickets to the city zoo. It’s their wedding anniversary so what better way to celebrate? Except when they get there, all the animals are clockwork. Ray goes off to buy an ice cream and he comes back to find his wife has become clockwork, too. The hospital can’t help, the police point him in the direction of our PI. When the Gumshoe discovers magpie flesh under Leonora’s nails, he knows things are serious. And what is the link between the zoo and Charon, the biggest crook this city’s seen?

**THE STRING CITY MYSTERIES**

"A hard-boiled private investigator with a talent for twisting dimensions … a beautiful dame … a changeling baby made of wood … the perfect ingredients for the first of my String City Mysteries, a series of fantasy noir detective romps due to be published by 40k Books throughout 2012.

I wrote _The Wooden Baby_ immediately after devouring a Dashiell Hammett anthology. I’m not the first to mix up the fantasy and detective genres, but it’s such a juicy collision I can’t resist it. Later stories in the series explore the strange city where my nameless gumshoe lives, but this first adventure just places him in an anonymous office in the middle of, apparently, nowhere.

_The Wooden Baby_ by Graham Edwards was first published in the April 2005 edition of [Realms of Fantasy](http://www.rofmag.com/)."

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

«Rain sluiced down the window, smearing my view of the couple on the street corner. It was dark too, so they weren’t much more than shadows. Strange, given it was just past noon. The rainclouds, maybe.

Still, I could see enough. The man was hunched over, head in his collar like a turtle in its shell. His left hand was clamped to the dame’s waist. With his right hand he was fending off something coming down at him out of the sky. It looked like living fog. I wiped my breath off the inside of the window and saw it wasn’t fog at all.

It was birds.»
