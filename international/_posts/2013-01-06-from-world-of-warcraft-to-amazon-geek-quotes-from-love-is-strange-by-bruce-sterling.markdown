"There are Futurist conferences," wrote Käthe in [her review](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ASBPAWY/), "philosophy, fashionable Italians, Brazilian voodoo, Swedish Methodism, steampunk novelists, time travel and state secrets. Although set now, amid the ongoing international financial turmoil, I would expect this to appeal to those who enjoy all the similar sorts of elements of  "The Diamond Age".   
Best of all, it's a romance likely to appeal equally to men and women, tech fanciers and artists. It is amusing, quirky, earnest, and charming."

We picked some geek quotes for you:

**The music business is the walking dead!**

«Eliza opened her furry black satchel. She pulled out a portable CD player. “Gav, look here. Once, I loved this machine. Because it plays all my CDs. But nobody buys music in the stores any more! Even I don’t pay for music, and I’m rich! I’m carrying a zombie in my purse!”  
“Well, yes, that platform is obsolete now, but a new business model will arise for music.”  
“No it won’t! That’s a lie! Nobody will ever pay! The music business is the walking dead! Don’t lie to me.” Eliza stuffed her doomed device back in her furry purse.  
Gavin rubbed his chin. “Your Digital Native generation really has some issues.”»

**Amazon had been invented to sell sci-fi books. The least chic thing in the world.**

«All the Amazon guys around Seattle were also aware of the trend. They all knew that, someday, European haute couture would sell online. The problem was that feat couldn’t be done by anybody from Amazon. Because Amazon guys were hacker geeks and cheesy hicks. Amazon had been invented to sell sci-fi books. The least chic thing in the world.  
The European couture biz would never go anywhere near a dorky sci-fi geek like Jeff Bezos. As for Jeff himself, Jeff would much rather conquer outer space with his private rocket than ever dress the First Lady of France.»

**World of Warcraft**

"I'm Level Eighty on Warcraft."  
The clerk was stunned.  "You're Level Eighty?!  Are you Horde, or Alliance?"  
"What, are you kidding me?  I'm Horde, of course!  I'm a Level Eighty Undead Priestess.  What Guild are you in?"  
"I'm a Horde Blood Elf Paladin. Level 30.  I'm in the Blood Roses Guild."  
"Have you ever seen a 'Spectral Tiger' loot card?  I bet you never have."  
The museum clerk thought about her situation.  The psychic pressure was mounting on her.    She was in a state of moral anguish.  "Look, Signora, I'd love to help your American clients there... But if my director knew I was Warcrafting here at work, she'd  kill me!  Besides, you don't have any 'Spectral Tiger' in your purse, I bet."

**Jeff Bezos and his private space rocket**

«“So, Sally, what’s new around here?”  
“Jeff Bezos just sold off two million shares.”  
“So, why would our sci-fi paperback bookseller need to sell that much Amazon stock?”  
“I think Jeff needs the cash for his private space rocket.”»

**The Internet would crack these nuts**

«She had Google, and she had Wikipedia. She could look up anything obscure, any words or phrases that she didn’t understand. A romance novel was just a book, while the Internet was the Internet. The Internet would crack these nuts for sure.»

**I may dress like a nerd**

«Look, Brixie, I may dress like a nerd, but I can read trends. Yeah, I can tell you what to do.»

**Optimistic startup guys**

«Gavin did not enjoy his hard work. The optimistic startup guys sending in these crazy proposals were guys who enjoyed their work. Gavin had the solid, old-fashioned idea that work should be painful, so that people would pay you for doing it. If the “work” was fulfilling, then work was a form of entertainment. The workers should be paying people for being entertained.»

**She was such an Internet fiend ...**

«Brixie wasn’t talking to him, or listening to him. Nothing like that at all. Brixie was off in her own world, flaming away like a blowtorch. She was such an Internet fiend that she had never learned any other way to behave.»

**Disintermediation**

«Brixie’s blog was huge. That had to be it. Brixie had a monster fashion blog. All those Los Angeles girls with their feet on the pedals of daddy’s sports car... Speedometers twitched in Milan whenever those girls changed their shoes... And Brixie knew how to make the girls in L.A. change their shoes.  
Dr. Gustav Y. Svante had warned him about this. This was an Internet thing: “disintermediation.”»

**The future**

«Once, I went to this little meeting of Microsoft kids. Like, this high-school trip thing, but it was very exclusive. We met the world’s greatest Futurist there. Dr Gustav Y. Svante. Nobody knows who he is. That’s why he’s the world’s greatest Futurist. He told us... He said that the future was already here, but nobody listens to the future. The future is all around us, but we don’t see the future yet. We don’t hear it or see it, so we can’t tell it.”»

**Steampunk**

«“I meant, tell me all about this steampunk thing!” Gavin broke in. “How does that concept work out for you people, here in Brazil?”  
“You don’t know about steampunk?” shouted Xavier, dubiously.  
“Well, I don’t read many novels! Because I’m kinda fully-booked already! But, obviously, you’re a science fiction writer at a Futurist conference! And I can see that you’re all dressed up like some fancy guy from the past, from the 19th century! So what gives with that? What is all that about?”»

**Sci-fi predictions**

«“Looks like your sci-fi prediction came true right away, Xavier.”  
“That can be gratifying,” mused the novelist. “But not all the time.”»

**Facebook is like his new drug**

«“Everybody is in trouble with my dad. My dad only sort of gets the Internet. My dad started looking up all his old enemies on Facebook. My dad picks big flamewar fights. It’s like my dad just discovered that people can talk about politics without his permission. Facebook is like his new drug, he’s getting all sweaty and manic... Farfalla, is Facebook the work of the Devil? Google is ‘not evil,’ but nobody ever said that Facebook was ‘not evil.’”»
