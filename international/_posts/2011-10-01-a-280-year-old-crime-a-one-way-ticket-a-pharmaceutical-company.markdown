**[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/jamie_sito2.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=11772)THE STORY**

After serving nearly 300 years in prison, convicted murderer, Norman Gilmore is released a free man, and the oldest living human on record. But he shuns his fame and heads off to Mars to find the answer to a question that has been plaguing him for nearly his entire lifetime.

A 280-year-old crime. A one way ticket. A pharmaceutical company. A bioengineering discovery. A gripping story filled with the ghosts of the past.

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

"There were 3,260 rivets lining the walls, floor and ceiling of the airlock. Norman had plenty of time to count them. He remembered very little of the day in which (so he was told) he killed four of his crew-mates..."

**FIRST REACTIONS**

"The thriller sense is maintained during the whole story. The use of intertextuality is also a wise move..."
