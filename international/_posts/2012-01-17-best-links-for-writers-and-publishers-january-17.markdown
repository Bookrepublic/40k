**STATS FROM AMAZON'S KDP SELECT PROGRAM MIGHT REQUIRE A DECODER RING**

"Don't drop your publisher and jump on board the Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) Select train just yet. As with most statistics Amazon releases, there are nearly as many questions raised as stats provided. Laura Hazard Owen at PaidContent laid it all out on the table, presenting Amazon's press release statement with stats and then listing a variety of questions those stats sparked."

**WHY IS FABER RUNNING A SELF PUBLISHING COURSE?**

"Selling books is easy now, right?
Well, we don't think that's quite how it works. Anyone with an ereader knows the horrors of poorly formatted files, with the dodgy line breaks and eyesore font changes that come with a free e-copy of a classic. And anyone who has ever browsed an ebook retailer's wares knows that you need a bit more than a catchy title and the right tags to generate sales.
When you self-publish, you are in complete control. You take on all the responsibility and reward for your book, but you also take on a challenge."

**A PUBLISHER'S PERSPECTIVE ON EBOOKS**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/fleck-nisbet-art.jpeg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/fleck-nisbet-art.jpeg)"In spite of these massive changes and the hurdles we face, there is much that is encouraging about the industry’s shift toward digital. According to a recent study of ebook enthusiasts, 40% said they read more now than they did in print. The proliferation of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Goodreads makes it easier than ever for publishers to market their books to the right audience and to keep them engaged. We can bring authors together with readers and readers can share with other readers in ways that have never before been possible. Online discoverability means good books and apps can be easily recommended by satisfied customers. As publishers, therefore, our goals are two-fold: We must continue to produce the best content possible while investing in the digital business in service of content and platforms yet to come."

**AGENTS IN CONFLICT**

"The obvious source of conflict is that an agent’s advocacy for the author may be tinged if not tainted by the agent’s self-interest as a buyer. In determining the disposition of a client’s property, the agent must now promote his own publishing company as a valid candidate for publication. Is the agent’s e-book company better than Random House, HarperCollins or Simon & Schuster? It may actually be, but the agent has disqualified himself from objectively advising his client one way or another. This puts the author in a quandary: whom can he or she now turn to for an unbiased evaluation?"

**EBOOKS AND APPS INNOVATION EXCITING PUBLISHERS DESPITE PRICE CONCERNS**

"Speaking at the event was Dan Franklin, digital publisher at Random House. He warned the publishing industry not to treat digital as a silo.
"Digital publishing now is publishing. This should now be in everyone's heads as a completely integral part of what we do. Even though, yes, at the moment it's 10% of the market. But by the end of this year it should be 20%," he said."

**A STUDY CONFIRMS WHAT WE'VE ALL SENSED: READERS ARE EMBARACING EREADING**

"Consumers who migrate to digital are spending less on physical hardcover and paperback books. The research supports this out quite clearly. That said, respondents to the survey actually report increasing their overall dollar spending as they make the transition to ebooks. Almost 70% of the respondents to the August 2011 fielding reported increasing their ebook expenditures, compared with 49% in the October 2010 fielding. Respondents reported increased spending on books in all formats to a greater degree than they reported decreased spending. Assuming the publishing industry can develop the right business models, this is good news."

**WILL MORE PEOPLE READ BOOKS BECAUSE OF E-BOOKS? PUBLISHERS NOT SO OPTIMISTIC**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/childipad1.jpeg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/childipad1.jpeg)"Now, anyone with an e-reader, tablet computer or smartphone and the right software is carrying around the world’s biggest books store, with literally millions of titles at their fingertips. Amazon has said in the past that those who buy their Kindle e-readers increase their reading consumption.
People have become accustomed to filling in smaller and smaller breaks in their day with reading on portable devices, according to David Weinberger, a senior researcher at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society, an Internet research lab. People are not necessarily reading books, however."

**EBOOKS: HAS AMAZON TURNED EBOOKS INTO COMMODITIES?**

"Amazon, by aggressively courting the indie author and by aggressively pricing indie titles, has expanded what readers will search to find a good book to read. And Amazon has gone the further step with its Prime Lending program and Kindle Direct Publishing programs. Amazon has given its stamp of approval to indie books and authors. Although I think Amazon is not a bookseller to patronize because of its desire to monopolize the integrated book market, it deserves a great deal of credit for changing books into commodities.
I know that many of you will clamor to say that I am wrong, but I ask you to consider this: Once you have bought and read the latest release from your favorite author, do you stop buying and reading books until that author’s next release in 2 or 3 years or do you continue to buy and read books within that genre? And if you do continue to buy and read books, do you continue to be entertained by them or are you only entertained by books written by your favorite author? Finally, do you rush out to buy your favorite author’s newest release or do you wait for a less expensive edition to appear?"
