**NO PREDICTIONS THIS YEAR; JUST QUESTIONS**

"Rather than predict the future for the industry’s biggest players, I am posing what I think are the biggest questions faced by each category of them. Some of the questions are within their power or responsibility to answer; some depend on outside circumstances; and some may never be answered at all. But any honest futurist (and I try to be one) has to admit that questions outnumber answers."

**TEN DARING PREDICTIONS FOR 2012 FROM THE INDIE AUTHOR TRENCHES**

"The reality is, to thrive and not just survive, everyone in publishing must be willing to change on a dime and innovate.  My background in Special Forces taught me how to do that.  Also, it taught me that to succeed, I must take risks.  The company isn’t called Who Dares Wins for nuthing (as we say in da’ Bronx).
What do I see for 2012 in publishing from the perspective of someone who spent two decades in traditional publishing and two years in indie publishing?"

**2012 DIGITAL PERSPECTIVES: THE CONSUMER**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-surfers.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/silver-surfers.jpg)"We now live in a global world where consumers are connected 24x7 and can compare prices at a click of a mouse. They no longer are influenced by newspapers, magazines, TV, radio but now have a virtual world of information available in a click on the move. Importantly, the largest power block is not the youth, but the silver surfers, who now have the greater disposable income and time, are increasingly technically savvy and are the heavier book readers."

**DEAR READERS: PUBLISHERS THINK OF YOU AS COSTUMERS I SWEAR**

"I decided to ask someone who I figure is in a position to know better than I; namely, Patrick Nielsen Hayden, who in addition to being my editor at Tor, is also that publisher’s Manager of Science Fiction, which means he spends a lot of time talking to other people in Macmillan about various publishing issues, including reader relations. The question I asked him specifically was: «Based on your own personal experience as an editor and in your involvement with major league publishing over the years, do major publishers see readers as customers? Or is major publishing customer focus solely on retailers?»"

**2012 PUBLISHING PREDICTIONS**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Predictions.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Predictions.jpg)"In 2012, the U.S. is electing a new president. The Summer Olympics go to London. The Queen of England celebrates her Diamond Jubilee. And according to the Mayans, the world is going to end.
But what does 2012 hold for authors? We wanted to know so we asked experts from across the book publishing industry. We did not let them see each others predictions so pay attention to the duplicate predictions."

**IS INDIE THE NEW BLACK?**

"2011 alone has been a phenomenal year for Indie Authors. The closing of Borders and Barnes and Noble bookstores has raised the demand of eReaders. We are seeing more bold authors taking a new approach and embracing the Indie movement. The Amazon Kindle became the most sought after reader when they launched their first Kindle in 2007. The gadget was reasonably priced and soon consumers found it more convenient to download a book versus purchasing the hard copy. In terms of pricing point, eBooks are more affordable than the paperbacks and hard bound books."

**E-BOOKS - THE BIGGER PROBLEM**

"The necessity above all else of keeping your metadata might seem like a geeky affectation – something that is really only of interest to librarians (itself not a bad reason) or trainspotterish data-completists – but it is in fact the simplest and cheapest route for a publisher to future-proof their business. Your revenue depends on it. Remember, we’re talking about a business sector whose incumbents are trying to transition from having an advantage regarding printing and distribution, to having an advantage regarding content."

**TABLETS, E-READERS CLOSING BOOK ON INK-AND-PAPER ERA**

"«I'm among those who believe that the new e-book craze expands a person's interest in reading overall,» said Gartner analyst Allen Weiner.
«When you can get someone excited about reading in any way, you turn on the reading ignition and it leads to all content,» Weiner said, adding that ink-and-paper works will continue to hold a place in the mix."

**2011: THE SELF-PUBLISHING YEAR IN REVIEW**

"When the AAP figures for this month were released two months later, they revealed a historic milestone: e-books became the dominant format for the first time, outselling both paperback and hardcover, capturing 29.5% of the market. In less happy news, storm clouds were gathering at Borders, and the signs weren’t good."
