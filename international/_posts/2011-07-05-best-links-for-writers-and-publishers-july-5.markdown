**7 PLATFORMS CHANGING THE FUTURE OF PUBLISHING**

"Depending on whom you ask, these are either the best or the worst of times for the written word. As with every other branch of traditional media, the Internet has pushed the publishing industry to a critical inflection point, something we’ve previously discussed. Disrupting the mainstream marketplaces for journalism, literature, and the fundamental conventions of reading and writing themselves, here are seven startups that promise to reshape the way we create and consume ideas."

**7 PUBLISHERS TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT**

"Developments in technology, the downfall of bookshops and the changing attitudes of readers have left the publishing world in a state of flux. Whilst some publishers take a ‘wait-and-see’ approach others seem to have embraced the chaos and have reacted with some interesting and innovative publishing experiments. Below are just a hand full of publishers who are trying to get it right…"

**BOOK INDUSTRY BALANCE CONTINUES TO TILT TOWARDS THE AUTHOR**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2283319494_8e54bfdb1d_z-e1309885576702.png)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9938)"[...] same tools that these authors have used, whether it’s Twitter or YouTube or the Kindle Singles publishing platform and 99-cent books, are available to anyone who wants to use them. In a lot of ways, this takes more effort than simply signing with an agent and then complaining when the publisher doesn’t promote your novel properly and your sales tank — but at the same time, it gives authors more power to affect their own future, and create their own success."

**'DISCOVERABILITY' KEY IN PUBLISHING INDUSTRY'S TRANSFORMATION**

"Successful self-published authors face the same decision, as traditional publishing houses are increasingly mining e-book best-seller lists for break-out success stories and offering those indie authors who succeeded in the self-published world the chance to "sell out" for a large advance."

**WHY "WORLD RIGHTS, ONE COVER" IS NOT THE BEST IDEA**

"Now, the idea of selling all territorial rights to a publisher is a good one in some cases. Sometimes, an offer is made that is so high that it makes sense to sell British and translation rights. Sometimes, a publisher has a strong presence in all the major English language markets, and it makes sense to sell World English. Sometimes, you have no other interest in a book except from one publisher; the publisher refuses to offer for anything but World; and your client really wants to have his book published. So you grant the publisher World Rights, much to your chagrin, and smile through clenched teeth. But in other cases (and I would argue that in a majority of cases), the author benefits much more if they have a publisher on the ground in that country, doing their own homegrown promotion and creating a market-appropriate cover."

**FOR EBOOK DEVOTEES, READING IS A WHOLE NEW EXPERIENCE**

"A recent study by the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project reported that ownership of e-reader devices — like the Amazon Kindle, Barnes and Noble Nook, Sony Reader and Kobo eReader Touch — doubled between November 2010 and May 2011. Now 12 percent of adults over age 18 own one, while 8 percent own a tablet computer like the iPad. So what does the increasing popularity of these devices mean for the experience of reading? Do we read differently when we can get (almost) any book ever published, whenever we want?"

**THE FUTURE OF BOOKS**

"**2040: Authors Will Become Like Tamagotchi.**
Having determined that what readers want is a “sense of connection,” publishers will organize adopt-an-author promotions, repackaging writers along the lines of Webkinz and other imaginary pets. “Feeding” your favorite authors by buying their books will make their online avatars grow less pale and grouchy. If they starve to death on your watch you will lose social networking points. Book clubs will cultivate with their favorite writers the warm, fuzzy, organic bond a trainer develops with his or her Pokémon, a process that will culminate in staged fights-to-the-death between your author and the author sponsored by another book club. These fights will occur offline, since there will be one or two bookstores left and something has to happen there."

**PUBLISHERS: SHOUT IT LOUD**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_26750524.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9945)"E-book strategy has for far too long been a question of the problems that e-books pose. It is probably fair to say that publishing is not an industry of early adopters and given that most of us love physical books our reluctance to embrace the change is understandable. But it is surely time to get over the problems of conversion, of piracy, territoriality, pricing etc. Time to articulate the opportunities rather than the challenges."

**DO PUBLISHERS MARKET BOOKS?**

"This post is far from comprehensive, and like I said, it doesn’t apply equally to all publishers. But most of the larger houses I work with are providing many of the above listed marketing functions. I’m sure there will be questions because there’s no way I can cover this topic thoroughly in a single blog post."

**WHY IT'S TOUGH TO BE YOUR OWN EDITOR**

"Do I think an editor is an indispensable aspect of indie publishing? No. Good books will sell, even without extensive editing. But I do think a good editor is a valuable asset, even if you're an accomplished writer with a strong publishing history. Why? Because no matter how strong your writing is, you're going to have mental blind spots. You're going to make assumptions about the characters and the storyline that your readers won't necessarily share. You're going to write ambiguous sentences without realizing it. Everyone does, and most casual readers won't point them out to you."
