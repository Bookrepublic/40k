**THE REAL GATEKEEPERS IN PUBLISHING NOW? AUTHORS**

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/4.-Bob-Mayer.jpg)Left with those two choices, most people would say readers are now the gatekeepers.  To an extent they are.  But here’s the deal:  writers create the product.  The quality of the product is going to determine how readers react to it.  The ability to promote/market the product is going to determine if readers even get a chance to react to it.
So it’s actually the writer who is going to determine their own success or failure.
99.5% of indie/self-published authors will be gone in two years.  Other will take their place.  And be gone in two years.  The gatekeeper to a writer’s success is the writer.  Here are the trends I see that will determine the few who get through the gate..."

**WHAT AUTHORS CAN LEARN FROM THE BESTSELLER LIST**

"The gold standard for success as an author is to make the New York Times Best Seller list. That’s the big brand banner that publishers, authors and readers want to see on the front cover. It shouts “Read Me! I’m certified!” How does an author accomplish this feat? What does it take for a book to become a bestseller? Some of the answers are right there in the list. So let’s drill down and and see what can we uncover about writing, getting published and appealing to readers."

**THE MONEY IS ALL IN THE NUMBERS**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/dean1.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=11542)"Do the math: 9 million divided by about 100 books = 90,000 average sales per book. Did every book do that? Of course not. I had a couple that haven’t sold a thousand copies yet and never will. (Thankfully for the most part.) So that means I had books that sold way over that 90,000 copy average. Yup. I have one book that is still selling and just went past 1,100,000 copies. The point is that in both indie publishing and traditional publishing, it all averages out. More on this later."

**HOW THE CROWD IS SHAPING THE FUTURE OF STORYTELLING**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/books-360.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=11543)"In the modern world of broadcast and publisher media, the traditional model relies on a series of individuals reading and choosing which stories will appeal to broad audiences. These gatekeepers evaluate commercial and literary potential based on books that have previously succeeded. Daring stories that push boundaries and bend categories may be passed over because they are more difficult to market. But the tastes of readers and viewers often progresses more quickly than the stories readily available to them reflect.
But what if we created lots of little fires around which writers could tell their stories and gauge the reaction of a keen audience, improving their storytelling before bumping up against the traditional media filter? Would we get more interesting stories? Could we uncover a new group of brilliant creators who might not have connections to those gatekeepers?"

**WHY DIRECT PUBLISHING WILL PREVAIL**

"[...] system wasn't going to budge until we found a way to preserve those advantages in a new system. And that's exactly what direct publishing (that is, publishing done directly by the author through the retailer, whether POD or digital) does -- it still allows for wide proliferation of high-risk books, while minimizing the risk to retailers. Now the risk is borne by the authors instead of by the publishers, but the author also reaps much higher benefits -- as much as 70% of the cover price on digital downloads, and a variable amount on POD texts.
And this is why direct publishing will ultimately overtake other distribution models. Now, there is still some advantage to authors to being traditionally published, though those advantages are smaller than they were and continue to shrink. Let's break this down by function, and you'll see what I mean."

**THE FUTURE OF PUBLISHING: RETAIL?**

"I've been saying this for a while. Readers are, first and foremost, customers. They/we must be wooed. Publishers need to control retail space, concrete and virtual, even if it's just kiosks in malls. Think Apple stores for readers. Oh, and they need brilliant--not just good, but brilliant--customer service, and extraordinary info capture. Amazon already has all that. Publishers need to catch up."

**HOW TO SELF PROMOTE WITHOUT SELLING YOUR SOUL**

"Well, not quite. Instead if you're feeling guilty about self-promotion, try stepping back and ask yourself these three questions."
