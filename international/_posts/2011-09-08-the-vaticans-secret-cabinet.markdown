_"Anyone who has ever been associated with the art colony in Rome will have heard of a certain “secret cabinet” hidden somewhere in the labyrinth of the Vatican Museums. It was the near-misfortune of one of the most renowned art dealers in Rome to have been exposed, recently, to the contents of that very real cabinet. _

_The peculiar circumstances of his involvement are set out, in unflinching detail, in the following report."_

A story in which sex and society stand in uneasy relationship.

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

“The level of morality in Italy befits the ninth circle of Hell."

**FIRST REACTIONS**

"Readers will enjoy reading as if the text were written with Italian accent. Funny moments, deliberately mistaken names, whimsical lines, double-meaning ideas and a very careful prose make The Vatican's Secret Cabinet a nice text to read which is waiting to be opened as a cabinet full of dirty little (and big) secrets."
