**DO BARNES AND NOBLE HAVE A DIGITAL STRATEGY?**

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/barnesandnoble.jpeg)"We can see that B&N is not going to win the battle against Amazon’s Kindle platform. Their pockets are not deep enough, neither are the strategically positioned even within the US, let alone outside it, to do so. Can they be happy being the number two in the US or even lower and nowhere outside the US? Will Apple or Google inflict more damage to their market share? As Apple prepares to launch its own self publishing offer and go textebook and Google prepares a tablet, where would Nook stand?"

**THE DIGITAL FUTURE STILL IS A MYSTERY IF YOU DON'T PUBLISH "IMMERSIVE READING"**

"The publishers of the rest of the book output who have depended on the bookstore network would appear to have a far more onerous challenge. They have to largely reinvent their product and perhaps their business models to get some digital revenue without any blueprint for success. In fact, there may not be a replicable template for how we satisfy consumers of much of the non-immersive content which for hundreds of years has been presented in books. But the publishers of those books have no choice except to look for one. With increasing urgency."

**JAMES PATTERSON SEES EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN EBOOK SALES**

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/James-Patterson-006.jpeg)"Suffice to say James Patterson is continuing to lead the charge of authors who sell their wares digitally. 5 million ebooks in just a few years is a huge positive step forward and the attention he draws will allow the industry to continue to grow. Hachette obviously sees dollar signs with the low cost digital offerings and may prompt them to take gambles on lesser known authors to and find the next James Patterson."

**TRADITIONAL VS SELF-PUBLISHING: NEITHER IS THE PERFECT SOLUTION**

"Dan Gillmor (@dangillmor) is one of a growing number of authors who have published with both a traditional house as well as self-published. Like many others, he's decided neither is the perfect solution. In this video podcast, Dan talks about the pros and cons of both options. He offers valuable insight not only for authors trying to decide between traditional and self-publishing, but his thoughts are extremely important for everyone in publishing to hear as they think about their roles going forward."

**HOW E-READING CHANGES HABITS - A TESTIMONIAL**

"As a result of having plenty of unread books on his Kindle, Basch now finds he doesn’t watch TV anymore—there isn’t ever a time when he no “next” book to keep him from watching something on the tube. He also finds that he goes through books a lot faster than he used to because he can also read them on the Kindle app on his computer or his phone. He writes that whether a book is available for Kindle influences his decision on what to read next, and is seeing printed books as deadweight. He also reports that the Kindle is so cheap now that he sees it as a “physical app”—he’ll use it until it breaks and order another one without a second thought."

**AS CELEBRITIES CHOOSE AMAZON, IS THIS THE END FOR PUBLISHERS?**

"Richard Curtis, a prominent agent, added that Amazon's growing dominance of its field was upending the status quo in almost every corner of the traditional book industry. «Everyone's afraid of Amazon,» he said. «If you're a bookstore, Amazon has been in competition with you for some time. If you're a publisher, one day you wake up and Amazon is competing with you too. And if you're an agent, Amazon may be stealing your lunch because it is offering authors the opportunity to publish directly and cut you out. It's an old strategy: divide and conquer.»"

**TRADITIONAL BOOKS, DRESSED TO KILL...**

"The immediate future of the book is clear. E (electronic) is for easy; P (print) is for posterity. Book readers today are leading double lives. We are faithful to our libraries at home, but stray towards the delights of digital the moment we board a plane, train or automobile.
The pleasures of E means downloading the new book we fancy, from reviews, word-of-mouth or plain curiosity. The satisfactions of P come from acquiring lovely print editions for our bookshelves. In due course, but not quite yet, the world's writers and their agents will work out how fully to monetise this double market."
