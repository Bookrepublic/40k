«We may be barking up the wrong tree in thinking of intelligence as something we can construct mechanistically. But there are other routes to a Vingean Singularity. Augmented intelligence, as opposed to artificial intelligence, is one such route: we may not need machines that think, if we can come up with tools that enable us to think faster and more efficiently. The world wide web seems to be one example. Lifelogging and memory prostheses may be another.»
