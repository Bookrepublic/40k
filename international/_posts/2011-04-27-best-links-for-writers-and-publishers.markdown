**THE FUTURE OF PUBLISHING**

"A lot of people claim that traditional publishing is broken and will eventually die. I disagree. Much like the changes that have occurred in the past in publishing, the big six will survive and so will agents. I do not have any insider knowledge or hidden agenda, nor do I profess to know everything about publishing. Not by a long shot. But I do know how to read the signs of this evolution or revolution, depending on which side of the fence you are on. I believe there have been many signs. Here is how I foresee they will do it."

**PUBLISHING THROUGH THE WORMHOLE.
A NEW FORMAT FOR THE BORN-DIGITAL PUBLISHER**

[![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Commonsense.jpg/300px-Commonsense.jpg)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Commonsense.jpg/300px-Commonsense.jpg)"If Thomas Paine were writing today, he would have a hard time finding a publisher for “Common Sense.”
Books and articles are the length they are because of the economics of their distribution.
A book — a long-form text — is tailored to distribution channels that involve shipping units through wholesalers to libraries and bookstores.  To support this method of distribution, books must be a certain minimum price or else the cost of moving the books around outstrips the revenue from each copy.  This is why a “short” book cannot be truly short:  it still has to bear a relatively high price and look like it’s worth it — for instance, in the physical world, a book needs to be thick enough so that, shelved spine-out in a bricks-and-mortar store, its title is visible to consumers."

**IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT PRICING FOR EBOOK FROM ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE**

"WSJ built their story around John Locke, whose thrillers are 99 cents and who earned well over $100,000 in March selling them on Kindle. Locke himself put the pricing in perspective. If his books are 99 cents and most ebooks from big publishers are $9.99 and up, he doesn’t have to prove he’s as good as they are; they have to prove they’re 10 times better than he is!
I can tell you this. I’ve read [one of John Locke’s books](http://kobobooks.com/ebook/Wish-List/book-086BdjX9h0qiC1TQraosqg/page1.html). Nobody I can think of is ten times better than he is. By his own criterion, he could readily sell for $2.99 (and be earning a higher percentage royalty) because nobody is three times better than he is, either."

**SELLING A NOVEL IN 140 CHARACTERS**

[![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/the_mark/portrait_photos/4947/original.jpg?1303750166)](http://s3.amazonaws.com/the_mark/portrait_photos/4947/original.jpg?1303750166)"If you want to succeed as a writer, you need to have a digital presence. At least, that was the message my publisher passed on to all its writers over a year ago. We needed websites. We needed blogs. We needed to tweet our new posts on our websites and blogs. We needed to engage in a conversation with our readers, because without them there would be no book sales, and without book sales our publisher would fold."

**THINK LIKE A PUBLISHER. THE SECRET OF INDIE PUBLISHING**

"I have heard over and over and over from indie publishers how their sales are not what they expected, or how they hope to promote their way to a big seller on their one book. Up to now I have mostly just bit my lip and kept my mouth shut.
So how can an indie publisher plan on making a living, paying the bills, without “luck” coming into play and without sending out thousands of flyers as I suggested last chapter?"

**DEATH OF THE BOOK: LONG LIVE EBOOKS**

[![](http://nationalpostarts.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ebooks.jpg?w=620)](http://nationalpostarts.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/ebooks.jpg?w=620)"Since books are the backbone of Western culture and education, it’s obvious that their place in our society matters. Even so, does this mean that every 21st-century development in the history of book publishing must be dreaded? Do new technologies give us no reason for joy or even a soupçon of hope?"

**EBOOK EVOLUTIONS: PUBLISHERS**

"Last week I discussed author Gary Ponzo and his success bypassing a hardcover deal and building a readership solely via Kindle and Amazon. As this April 21st Wall Street Journal article points out, he is not the only one going it alone; and the low price of eBooks by new writers on the block is putting pressure on the major publishing houses to lower theirs."

**WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF BOOKS?  KINDLE LENDING LIBRAY, PIRACY AND MORE**

[![](http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Kindle-Public-Library.jpg)](http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Kindle-Public-Library.jpg)"There are differing opinions as to what year will see digital downloads become the clear majority of book sales by number and revenue. Could be as early as 2015, probably not going to be later than 2025. There’s also debate as to what level printed media will sink to. It’s unlikely that physical books will completely disappear, but will they account for just 30% of sales? 10%? 1%? As interesting as that debate can be, I find it is dwarfed by a much larger question: how is the ‘death’ of print going to change media forever?"

**GUESS WHAT? NO ONE KNOWS HOW BIG THE E-BOOK BUSINESS IS**

"All the numbers suggest that e-books have some serious momentum. But when you look at all the data together, it’s clear that no one knows how big the business is, because the information is woefully incomplete. There’s no way to tell how many e-book titles sell, the most popular genres, or even who the most important publishers are."

**THE AWESOMENESS OF BEING A 2.0 AUTHOR**

"I don’t know how authors did it years ago. You pour your heart and soul into a book, it hits the shelves and you hope people like it.
I’m such a spaz that I don’t think I could handle the lack of immediate validation and/or rejection."

[](http://www.unmarketing.com/2011/01/11/the-awesomeness-of-being-a-2-0-author/)**IS SIGNING WITH A MAINSTREAM PUBLISHER NOW A 'MISTAKE'?**

"I suppose it was inevitable. As self-e-publishing has drawn more and more attention, with relatively major-name authors deciding to forego pro-publishing and go it alone, and over 1/4 of the Amazon Top 100 list being made up of such books, now signs of an anti-pro-publishing “backlash” have popped up. Blogger switch11 at iReaderReview points out the “mistake” one popular self-publishing author made when he decided to sign up with Macmillan. There’s no other way to put it – Signing a book deal was a huge mistake. John Rector could have been a Top 100 Kindle Store Author. He could have had multiple books in the Top 100."
