**AMANDA HOCKING, STORYSELLER**

“I’d always known that if I could get the right deal, I would take it,” she said. “But I wouldn’t have gotten this kind of deal six months ago.” It’s a deal that pays less than what Amazon, in partnership with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, bid, but there were doubts about whether the big bookstore chains would carry a book published by their competitor. (Also, Hocking says, Amazon wanted to restrict e-book rights to the Kindle and offered a lower rate of royalties than she often gets from what has been self-published.) And Hocking wants to reach as many people as possible among the 85 percent or so of the population who don’t have e-readers yet. “For me to be a billion-dollar author,” she would tell me later, “I need to have people buying my books at Wal-Mart.”

**SELLING 1000 EBOOKS A DAY**

"In January of 2011, I sold 347 ebooks on Kindle for the entire month.  Last month, I averaged selling over 1,000 ebooks in a day and that number continues to rise. Lately there have been a number of articles about the ‘gold rush’ to self-publishing and it appears that I’ve struck a rich vein, but let me explain how this has happened to put it in perspective and give a template for success."

**FICTION RULES EBOOKS
**

**![](http://www.publishersweekly.com/images/data/ARTICLE_PHOTO/photo/000/005/5233-1.JPG)Fiction is the leading sales driver of e-books, and just how dominant that segment has been is clearly seen in a new market study just released by Bowker.
According to "2010–2011 U.S. Book Consumer Demographics & Buying Behaviors Annual Review," fiction accounted for 61% of unit sales in 2010 and 51% of revenue, putting it far ahead of other segments.
The children's segment generated 12% of unit sales in 2010, placing it second behind fiction, while nonfiction accounted for the second highest amount of e-book revenue in 2010, with the segment representing 14% of sales.

**POST-ARTIFACT BOOKING**

The primary shift is one of thinking of the book as a process rather than artifact. We are moving from the culture of the book to the culture of booking. Our focus is no longer on the book, the noun, but on booking, the verb -- on that continuous process of thinking, writing, editing, writing, sharing, editing, screening, writing, screening, sharing, thinking, writing -- and so on that incidentally throws off books. Books, even ebooks, are by-products of the booking process.

**ALL ABOUT BOOK CLUBS**

"Book clubs are such solid fixtures in the lives of authors, agents, and publishers that we take them for granted, like enormous monuments that we no longer notice on our way to work every day. How impoverished our literary environment would be without book clubs can easily be grasped when you realize that millions of Americans subscribe to them. And because changes in pricing, reader tastes, distribution, marketing, and other trends have drawn new attention to the functions of book clubs, this is a particularly good time to examine this phenomenon."

**EVERY GOOD EBOOK NEEDS A GOOD EDITOR**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Ebook-005.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9646)"[...] this is representative of a larger view across the spectrum of online publishing where the author, not a publisher, controls the process. That's fine by me – as long as you're not going for posterity or longevity, because though I am an avid consumer of all kinds of writing on the web, I firmly believe there's a big difference between a book published online by the author and one prepared for publication by a publisher, and it goes to the very heart of what books and literature mean to us."

**DATA HELPS US UNDERSTAND EBOOK PRICING IMPACTS**

"There is legitimate debate about how bestseller lists should be organized in the ebook age. I pointed out last winter that it really wasn’t tenable for ebook lists to keep score on unit sales only when the price range extended from 99 cents to $19.99. And, in fact, that kind of price variation has already led to clever authors and publishers gaming the system: lowering prices to get on bestseller lists and then raising them to capitalize on the additional discovery that takes place once they’re on."
