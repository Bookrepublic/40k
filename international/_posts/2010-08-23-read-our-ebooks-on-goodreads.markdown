Our ebooks are now [available on Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4088119?shelf=read). You can easily purchase and read them with the embedded aReader. As pointed out by [Guy LeCharles Gonzalez](http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2010/goodreads-takes-next-step-in-social-reading/), the iPhone app also works pretty well on the iPad.


> The Goodreads iPhone app, which also launched in March, has been downloaded by more than 30,000 readers so far, and was updated yesterday to add an intriguing new feature: an embedded eReader. Fully integrated with the app, the eReader connects to usersâ€™ profiles and allows them to add eBooks to their shelves, add notes, and share their progress with their friends. They can also purchase and download eBooks via the mobile site without leaving the app. (NOTE: It also works pretty well on the iPad.)
Goodreads eBooks are in ePUB format, DRM-free
