"Ereaders are literally changing the way we read. But for all the efficiency and portability they offer, they lack the curious romance of reading a book in its hard, physical form—not least the charms that lie on the cover.

These days, Kindles start up on the first chapter of a book, so it's increasingly easy to only ever see the cover a handful of times as a small thumbnail image. But while many wallow in the fact such a shift is disastrous but inevitable, the likes of Craig Mod—formerly of Flipboard—are embracing the change. In fact, he's written a wonderful essay about the problem, and possible solutions, over on his blog."
