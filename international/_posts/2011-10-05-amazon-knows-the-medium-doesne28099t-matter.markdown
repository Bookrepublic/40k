_Kinley Levack, "Amazon Knows the Medium Doesn’t Matter"_

"If any company could propel an ebook-first publishing model, it is probably Amazon. With the popularity of the Kindle and the extensive information the company holds on its clients, Amazon is better positioned than most to push targeted ebooks to customers. The company even released a statement earlier this year showing that ebooks are outselling print books on Amazon.com. Despite this, Amazon is foraying further into the print publishing world.

Actually, publishing isn't new for Amazon. It has published printed books through imprints such as AmazonEncore and AmazonCrossing for a few years. AmazonEncore identifies books that get great reviews from customers on the Amazon site. The books seem to have authors with money-making potential, but the books are self-published and don't have much marketing support."

**Money quote:**

"Yes, Amazon will continue to sell books from top publishers. But if it can look at its mountains of data and determine that there's an opportunity to serve a certain segment of its best customers with a certain type of book then it makes all the sense in the world for Amazon to become the publisher of the book, whether physical or digital. This is exactly what other publishers are trying to do-learn from actual readers what they want so the publisher can make more informed acquisition and publication decisions. Amazon just happens to be closer to the customer than any publisher, so it is in a better position to lead out in a customer-focused publishing world."
