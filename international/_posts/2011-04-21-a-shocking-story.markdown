If you love literary fiction, you should read [Jacob Appel](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=57).    
He won many important awards: Boston Review (1998), New Millennium (2004, 2007, 2008), Faulkner (2004), O. Henry Award (2001). And readers usually cannot forget Appel's stories.

Today we released the new one:

> **A SHOCKING STORY**
> 
> ![Vicarious Pleasures](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/vicarious-appel_GB-ok1.jpg)[Jacob Appel](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=57), deeper and creepier.
> 
> Jacob Appel dares to shock his readers once again. If you are looking for solutions, stop here. The author of Vicarious Pleasures doesn't answer, but he asked the most important questions.  
Can you image a more trivial situation than a naïve girl who spends her saturday night babysitting the little sister of the boy she is in love with? Appel, as usual, begins from such a homely picture to show how weak our certainties are, how creep our lives can become, how thin is the line between sanity and insanity.
> 
> Take a last look at your dream, they are crashing down like your image in a broken mirror.
