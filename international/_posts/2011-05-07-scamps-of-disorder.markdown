> Don't be polite. Don't be good. The world is evil. If you are innocent, then you are weak, you are exposed to the injustice of society. But you have a chance: try to increase the chaos in the world. This is what Scurrility Forepaws had learned from his father. And this what he is trying to do. But remember that: trying to be evil is not so easy, because you can't predict the effect of you behavior. Never.

> Do you think you are alive? Are you sure? Toby Knott, an obituary writer, is not. Well, he was. But when his wife broke up with him, she said: "You are dead to me". And since that moment, he is sure to be dead. Why not? If you have an answer, please follow his adventure and try it out.
