**![Still Point - Graham Edwards](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/9788865860984_sito.jpg)THE STORY**

Our PI finds himself in the bowels of the earth swapping stories with a many-tongued monster. He’s landed up there after his newly appointed angel assistant (with a body to-die-for) was zombifically assaulted by one of the City Cops planning to break into the vault containing the Still Point of the Turning World.

The lease on his business is about to expire. If the Fool breaks into the vault, so is the one on the whole of the world. Can Gumshoe save them both? And just what is the connection between the behemoth and the Still Point of the Turning World?

**THE STRING CITY MYSTERIES**

"A hard-boiled private investigator with a talent for twisting dimensions … a beautiful dame … a changeling baby made of wood … the perfect ingredients for the first of my String City Mysteries, a series of fantasy noir detective romps due to be published by 40k Books throughout 2012.

I wrote _The Wooden Baby_ immediately after devouring a Dashiell Hammett anthology. I’m not the first to mix up the fantasy and detective genres, but it’s such a juicy collision I can’t resist it. Later stories in the series explore the strange city where my nameless gumshoe lives, but this first adventure just places him in an anonymous office in the middle of, apparently, nowhere.

_The Wooden Baby_ by Graham Edwards was first published in the April 2005 edition of [Realms of Fantasy](http://www.rofmag.com/)."

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

«“The Still Point of the Turning World!” I said, wiping bird brain from the rim of my coffee cup. My heart was trying to climb out of my throat. Jimmy stared at me. Only one of his eyes was spinning. “This got anything to do with the end of the world, Jimmy?”

“Curious?” he said.

Next door, the secretary screamed as a fresh dust devil crept up behind her. Her newly blonde hair caught fire and all the flesh abandoned her bones, leaving a greasy skeleton grinning dismally into the mirror. Moaning, she put down the compact and went back to her typing.

“I guess I’m good ’til midnight,” I said. “Tell me more.”»
