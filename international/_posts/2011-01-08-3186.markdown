[Paul Di Filippo](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=306)'s picks for the the novels you just shouldn't miss: [11 sci-fi and fantasy novels we're looking forward to in 2011](http://blastr.com/2011/01/11-sci-fifantasy-novels-w.php).

[![Wikiworld - Paul Di Filippo - English version](../wp-content/uploads/wikiworld-difilippo_ok_t.jpg)](../?p=306)We are anxious to read _Fuzzy Nation_ by John Scalzi («Scalzi reinvents the first-contact story between humanity and those cuter-than-Ewoks aliens known as Fuzzies») and _Rule 34_ by Charles Stross (the story of  Detective Liz Kavanaugh, «who has to draw the line between innocent online fantasies and illegal -and deadly- scams»).

But, talking about [Paul Di Filippo](../?p=306), soon in 2001, after Wikiworld («One absolute knock-out  story… that is among the most exciting pieces of fiction I’ve read in years», said Cory Doctorow), we will publish another novelette: Return to XX Century.

Stay tuned.
