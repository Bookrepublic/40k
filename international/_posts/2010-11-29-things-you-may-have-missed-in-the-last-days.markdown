[![The Parthenopean Scalpel](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Parthenopean_eng_t1.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=1)



	
  * Robert McCrum, [This is the future, and it glows like ET](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/nov/28/robert-mccrum-kindle-booksellers)
_On screen and in print, it has been a year of mixed messages for the  book trade. But one reading at least says the future is bright_

	
  * O'Reilly: [Cyber Monday](http://post.oreilly.com/form/oreilly/viewhtml/9z1zf6pkmm2qona0s744opu47d9nr1dtc83rovoqlho)
_In celebration of Cyber Monday, we've extended our Deal of the Day to our entire catalog of ebooks_

	
  * Jeffrey carver, [Free Downloads Ending. Wait—What? ](http://starrigger.blogspot.com/2010/11/free-downloads-ending-waitwhat.html)
_The theory that free downloads drive _sales _of books, which apparently works for some writers, does not seem to have clicked for me._

	
  * Seth Godin, [The label has no assets, just desire](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/11/be-the-one-that-isnt-easily-replaced.html)
_Twenty years ago, self-publishing a record was difficult and  expensive. A big label could get you shelf space at Tower easily, you  couldn't. A big label could pay for a recording session with available  capital, but it was difficult for you to find the money or take the  risk. A big label could reach the dozens of music reviewers, and do it  with credibility. Hard for you to do that yourself. Now?_


**Writing**



	
  * Diane Duane: "[All fiction -even science fiction- is a subset of fantasy](http://io9.com/5700553/)"
_There is a rule for fantasy writers: The more truth you mix in with a lie, the stronger it gets._

	
  * Jane_ _Friedman, [3 Lessons in Publishing I’m Thankful For (That Writers Should Know About)](http://writerunboxed.com/2010/11/26/3-lessons-in-publishing-i%E2%80%99m-thankful-for-that-writers-should-know-about/)
_Wordsmithing takes you only so far; at some point, you write to sell._

	
  * Dark Worlds, [The Scale of the Fantastic](http://darkworlds21.blogspot.com/2010/11/scale-of-fantastic.html) | @SFSignal_
What I do like about Rabkin’s scale is it helps me to identify or codify  some types of fiction that don’t fall neatly into genres (which we must  remember were invented by publishers as a marketing tool, not  academics)._

	
  * Justine Musk,  [How to put heart & soul into your story structure](http://www.tribalwriter.com/2010/11/29/how-to-put-heart-soul-into-your-story-structure/)
_I think what explanations of story structure often fail to get at is the  story beneath the story, which is also its emotional heart.  And its  guts and brains and soul.  This is where the story works out its overall  meaning_


**Books | Reviews**



	
  * Nick Fagge, [Women writers at war over fake reviews on Amazon](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1333885/Amazons-amateur-book-reviewing-vicious-free-readers-victims.html) | @rienafaire
_The story involves subterfuge, jealousy and dirty tricks in the world of literature_

	
  * Aidan Moher, [Angry Robot Books is opening an online short fiction store. My thoughts](http://aidanmoher.com/blog/2010/11/asides/an-aside-angry-robot-books-opens-online-short-fiction-store/)
_I _do_ like the idea of a make-your-own-anthology style bundle  and hopefully the small cost means we’ll see eBooks created with proper  care and attention to aesthetics, something still lacking in much of the  ePublishing world._

	
  * E-Reads_, _[Nine Overlooked SciFi Classics, and E-Reads Has Two of Them](http://ereads.com/2010/11/nine-overlooked-scifi-classics-and-e-reads-has-two-of-them.html)
_‘From _The War of the Worlds_ to _1984_,’ we read in_ The Washington Post_, “some science fiction goes down in history. What about the brilliant books that got away?"_




**The World of 40k**






	
  * Mickey Blue Eyes [reviews](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/131159881) "The Parthenopean Scalpel" by Bruce Sterling
_«Great work, Maestro!»_

	
  * Paul Di Filippo [on Pynchon and research](http://s11.zetaboards.com/thefictionalwoods/topic/7357081/1/)
_Pynchon definitely set the gold standard prior to the internet for maximalist, insanely erudite fiction._

	
  * Rhys Hughes, on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/40kbooks):_ _«The next [Mischief](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=18) story will be set in the city of Calvino and will feature a robot version of Marco Polo...»

	
  * Livia Blackburne, [From Word to Brain](http://blog.liviablackburne.com/2010/11/from-words-to-brain-to-come-out-with.html)
_I'm happy to announce that my essay From Word to Brain will be coming out with 40K books.._.

  * Luca Conti, [Il futuro dei mondi virtuali è tutt’altro che segnato](http://www.pandemia.info/2010/11/29/il-futuro-dei-mondi-virtuali-e-tuttaltro-che-segnato.html)
_Credere che Second Life sia morta e sepolta e che i mondi virtuali siano stati soltanto una bolla mediatica significa non averne compreso la portata._

	
  * Liviaf [recensice](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/132024920) "Il Panchinaro" di Mike Resnick & Lezli Robyn
_Il finale agrodolce parla di cose "di grande  importanza per i ragazzi molto giovani, e per gli uomini molto vecchi",  ma commuove anche noi.._
