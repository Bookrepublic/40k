**RED LEMONADE | THE FUTURE OF PUBLISHING BEGINS WITH YOU - AND IT STARTS HERE, RIGHT NOW.**

"Publishing is saddled with this terrible reputation for being reactionary and Luddite, our denizens known largely for caviling against technology and the new-fangled. It is perverse, truly perverse since publishing is in fact at the center of two major social revolutions that dramatically disrupted the status quo ante."

**IS THE AD-SUPPORTED KINDLE REALLY THAT BAD?**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/kindle_ad_supported-300x286.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=8944)"Amazon started shipping its new ad-supported Kindle a couple of weeks ago and the first round of owners are beginning to experience if it is worth saving $25 on the device in exchange for viewing a couple of ads. The consensus: it’s not that bad."

**GARTNER SURVEY SHOWS DIGITAL TEXT CONSUMPTION NEARLY EQUAL TO TIME SPENT READING PRINTED PAPER TEXT**

“There are concerns that digital media will cannibalize print media, based on the general decline in newspaper sales and take-up of online news services in many parts of the world, but the evidence from our research is that print and online are not generally regarded as direct substitutes by consumers,” said Nick Ingelbrecht, research director at Gartner. “Something more complicated than a straightforward substitution of print to digital media is taking place.”[](http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1673714)

**HOW READERS EMBRACE ELECTRONIC BOOKS, BY PIOTR KOWALCZYK**

"The big surprise comes next: one-third of respondents never thought  about reaching for an electronic book so far. It means we must try  harder to find better, more convincing ways to engage readers in digital  content."

**8 LAWYERS THAT BECAME SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY AUTHORS**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/rotating.png)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=8923)"The legal profession seems to breed writers. John Grisham turned to  legal thrillers, Scott Turow and Meg Gardiner the same. And who could  forget the raucous and bawdy story of _Tom Jones_, penned (literally, it was the eighteenth century) by seated judge Henry Fielding? Science Fiction and Fantasy have their own cast of lawyers who have  turned their hand to writing. Some of these individuals are still  practicing law, others have become full-time writers, but each can point  to their profession as a part of their success as an author. Whether it  be discipline, knowledge, or skill, each owes some debt to their  argumentative and much maligned first profession."

**CHARLAINE HARRIS SELLS 1 MILLION KINDLE EBOOKS**

"When Amazon first unveiled the Kindle three and a half years ago, I would never have expected to be one of the first handful of authors in the Kindle Million Club," Harris said in Amazon's news release. "It's been an amazing few years for myself and the Kindle both, but even more so to have my books available to my readers in ways that just a few years ago would have seemed as fantastic as vampires coming out of the coffin."

**SHEESH! WE JUST GOT OVER THE DEATH OF BOOKS; NOW IT'S THE DEATH OF E-READERS?**

"The reason is simple: history proves that that given a choice between a dedicated device and a multifunctional one, it’s multifunctional every time. “As the demise of the Flip camera suggests, consumers are increasingly trading single-purpose devices for multifunction gadgets. Especially as the price of tablet computers continues to fall, experts predict users will drop e-readers for tablet PCs that offer web-browsing and video capabilities alongside e-books."

**AMAZON AS PUBLISHER, PUBLISHERS AS BOOKSELLERS**

"As Amazon the bookseller becomes Amazon the publisher, some publishers are starting to see their mandate expand into the role of booksellers. Last week, Simon & Schuster, Penguin and Hachette Book Group -- along with AOL/Huffington Post -- announced a joint online project, Bookish, which will sell print books and ebooks directly to consumers."

**10 LITERARY CITIES WE WISH WERE REAL**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/cities1.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=8914)"One of the many, many reasons why literature (and fictional narratives in general, really) endures as an art form is the escapist element. And authors particularly adept at world building only pique audiences’ imaginations even more, setting their tales in purely new countries, cities and/or universes swelling with explorative possibilities. Unsurprisingly, a fair amount of fans — or stressed-out students and workers — wouldn’t mind if more than a few of these managed to weasel their way into the real world."
