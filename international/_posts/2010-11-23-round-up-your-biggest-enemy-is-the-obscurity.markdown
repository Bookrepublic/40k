# Scott Timberg, [Philip K. Dick’s Masterpiece Years](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/books/23philip.html?_r=1&src=twt&twt=nytimesbooks)
_Much of what is revealed in the book is already known to scholars and is  part of the biographical record. But by putting Dick’s life into human  terms, Ms. Dick offers a window through which the curious —  from the  general reader to the fan boy  —  can approach this often inscrutable  author_
