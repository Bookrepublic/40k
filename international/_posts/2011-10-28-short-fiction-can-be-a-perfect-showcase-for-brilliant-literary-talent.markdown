excerpt: '<strong>Short Fiction Week</strong>: Marianne de Pierres: "If a short story
  is not well constructed and tightly written though, it can be much less satisfying
  that a novel. Also, people do look for value for money in reading, and short fiction

**Novels can have pauses, faults: a long story wins by points. A novelette, as Julio Cortazar wrote, needs to win by knock-out. Do you agree?**

Yes, probably. I think readers are much more forgiving about novels. With shorter fiction though, it has to sparkle brightly and intensely to make the same lasting impact.

**Is there a literary bias against the short form of fiction?**

I don’t think there is a literary bias against short fiction, in fact if anything, it can be a perfect showcase for brilliant literary talent. Take, for example, “Singing My Sister Down” by Margo Lanagan - one of the best, most powerful, pieces of fiction I’ve ever read.   
If a short story is not well constructed and tightly written though, it can be much less satisfying that a novel. Also, people do look for value for money in reading, and short fiction can sometimes be viewed as merely an entrée.

**Plot, setting, ideas. What are in your opinion the perfect ingredients of a novelette/novella?**

Tight plot, a powerful setting created in few words, a focussed idea. There is not time for plucking daisies in a novella.

**Would you suggest 3 must-read novelettes/novellas?**

I’m a big fan of Twelfth Planet Press’s novella series. From that I would recommend Siren Beat by Tansy Rayner Roberts and Nightsiders by Sue Isles. I’m also very keen to read Black Swan by Bruce Sterling published by 40K Books.
