  «These days it is necessary for me to take note of debates about the effects of ebooks on the publishing industry. I therefore took the time to read recent posts by Paul Cornell and Gary Gibson.

I don't pretend to have any answers here, but I'm pretty sure that demanding that everyone who wants to consume a particular piece of art should pay their fair share of the cost is only going to result in lowest common denominator art.

If the government is not prepared to do so, and in this country at least arts funding is being brutally decimated, then we have to do it ourselves.»
