> ****A** SHORT NOVEL THAT KEPT ME GLUED TO MY SEAT UNTIL THE VERY END******

> [](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=3365)![Keepsakes](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Ricordi_Resnick_Eng_t.jpg)“Imagine finding yourself in a desperate situation—perhaps even a matter of life or death—but you have no way to resolve the problem. Suddenly, as if sent from heaven, a Good Samaritan appears and says that he and his friends can help. All they require from you is a small monetary payment and a single object, a “keepsake,” from your home. Would you refuse?  
Keepsakes by Mike Resnick kept me glued to my seat until the very end”

> 
> A wonderful and intense short sci-fi novel. A great plot, with quirky and fascinating characters. A touching story you will not forget.
> 
> "They came like a plague, blown on the galactic winds.  
No one knew where they came from, no one knew where they were going, no one even knew for sure if they were human. One day they would appear and offer their services, and sometime later they would leave, their coffers filled to overflowing with broken dreams and shattered hopes. Oh, they were paid in currency, lots of it-but what they really traded in was misery.  
They had many names, some of their own devising, some not. The one that stuck was the Star Gypsies.  
It was my job to hunt them down. Of course, no one told me what to do when I caught them, because they usually hadn't broken any laws. Hearts, yes; dreams, absolutely. But laws? Not often, if at all."
