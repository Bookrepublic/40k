When we started to explore the possibilities for a new kind of journalism through ebooks, [we began](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=12800) an Italian series in co-edition with one of the most interesting Italian newspaper, La Stampa. The idea was

«to move in-depth analysis articles into a more flexible reading environment with a different reading experience compared to the paper one. We think this is a challenge to be embraced with new territory to explore and lots of possibilities still waiting to be discovered.»

Considering this as a new path for journalism, one where there is space for experimenting, starting with language and techniques, we have being publishing since 2011 several titles covering different topics and kinds of journalism: from investigative reports to economy, from cooking to biography, we had the chance to try very different solutions.
