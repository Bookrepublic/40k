  «"Trans Media" is the buzzword du jour of the entertainment industry but I'm not fond of it. That's because in order to have a product that truly crosses between print publishing, video games, film/animation and new media (such as iPhone), you must be able to understand how to create in each arena. I have the weird distinction, I think, of actually being able to create in all of these places because I'm currently working on projects in each of them. I think being able to guide a franchise through different media is the true definition of the term.»
