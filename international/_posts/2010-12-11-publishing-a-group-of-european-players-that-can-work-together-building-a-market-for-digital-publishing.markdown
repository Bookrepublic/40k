Finally, more details on the panel of players for the European digital publishing market research that will be presented at IF BOOK THEN: as well as Italy, the UK and Sweden, we now have Germany and Spain too.  

"Our goal", says Marco Ferrario, co-founder of Bookrepublic, "is to create a group of European players that can work together building a market for digital publishing with a common language and common actions, but at the same time a global vision"_».
