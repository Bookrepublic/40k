excerpt: '<strong>Richard Nash</strong>: "We need to go straight from recognizing
  their existence to recognizing that they are active participants in the making of
  culture, not just passive consumers, and the publisher needs to actively engage
  them in that, not just finally grasp they''re important and start grabbing their

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Publishing1.jpg)**Anis Shivani interviews Richard Nash (Huffington Post)**:

"I've been intrigued by Richard Eoin Nash since the time he ran the indie press Soft Skull Press in the 2000s. His new enterprise is [Red Lemonade/Cursor,](http://redlemona.de/) a reader/participant-oriented publishing venture hoping to take full advantage of the social potential of new media. I recently had the opportunity to talk to him via email about the future of publishing in a rapidly changing landscape."

**Money quote**

"Publishers need to not even think of readers as readers. We need to go straight from recognizing their existence to recognizing that they are active participants in the making of culture, not just passive consumers, and the publisher needs to actively engage them in that, not just finally grasp they're important and start grabbing their email address."
