_**AGENTS ASSISTING AUTHORS WITH SELF PUBLISHING, GOOD IDEA?**_

_![Julie Ortolon](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/julie.jpg)As more and more established authors go indie, either by e-pubbing their backlist or taking new material straight to ebook, many of us wonder: What will be the agent’s role in this new publishing frontier?  
That conversation came up repeatedly during the recent RWA conference in NYC. Among the authors I spoke with, everyone agrees that agents actually _becoming_ publishers is a bad idea.  
But, what about agents _assisting_ their authors with self publishing?

**AGENTS STEERING AUTHORS TOWARD SELF-PUBLISHING**

Weinstein took on the “nuts and bolts” role of publishing the e-book, carrying out tasks like hiring a copy editor, finding a cover designer and talking to e-book conversion firms, while Devlin is responsible for picking up those actual expenses. A traditional publisher, by contrast, would cover all those costs.  
Weinstein, who represents nonfiction authors exclusively, thinks e-singles could be a major growth area for his clients. “I’m asking them, ‘While you think about your next big book,’” he says, “‘is there a 15,000 word-er that you could do in the meantime?’”

**LITERARY AGENTS REINVENTING THEMSELVES**

With the publishing industry undergoing cataclysmic changes, and with self-publishing now a viable option for authors, it's only natural that literary agents are scrambling to position themselves.  
How are they going to make money in this new publishing business? How are they going to be relevant?

[](http://twitter.com/#!/laurapauling)**I HEARD AGENTS ARE GOING AWAY**

Those people who seem to think the agents are going away are simply those people who seem to think they will make millions of dollars from their self-publishing sales on Smashwords or other platform. In their world, there is no need for an agent. For that approach, you're right. You don't need me or any other agent. But, with that said, when things do go wrong for your writing career, when you don't find yourself where you want to be with your writing in 5, 10, or 20 years, remember that maybe, just maybe, that agent that you avoided early in your career might have been able to help you over that hurdle.

This post helps you understand the pros and cons of having a literary agent, so you can determine whether or not you want to try to secure an agent before you try to sell your book to a publisher.

**THOUGHTS ON TRADITIONAL PUBLISHING, AGENTS AND SELF-PUBLISHING **

I met with two agents and spent more time explaining what we were doing than getting information from them.  
During other conversations with agents and editors, it was quite clear to me that most had little idea of how effective ebook selling worked when the author is motivated to do it—ie profit sharing.  I’m selling 2,000 ebooks a day and expanding in sales every week.  From just a couple of hundred in a month in January, that’s an explosion.
