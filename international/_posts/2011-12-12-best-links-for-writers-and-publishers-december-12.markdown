**PAYING AUTHORS MORE MIGHT BE THE BEST ECONOMICS FOR A PUBLISHER IN THE LONG RUN**

"If the stores and other intermediaries they rely on go away, they have to find other ways to sell their books. That’s a challenge, no doubt.
But if the authors don’t play along, they have nothing to sell. Making deals with authors is the publishers’ price of admission to the game.
As the central player whose contracts and sales terms manage the distribution of revenues throughout the supply chain, how publishers view the commerce of our business is central to how it operates. This has, historically, been challenging. The activity of publishing is complicated and its economics are complicated."

**5 REASONS WHY INDIE AUTHORS ARE SUCCEEDING**

"I've talked directly with the editors of these publishing houses, listened to their questions and vision, and I've been introduced to their processes. In doing so, I've discovered something quite interesting: Indie authors know the state of publishing and without a shadow of doubt have a leg up on the latest ebook and publishing trends.
Does that surprise you?
Indie authors are gaining ground not only in popularity and credibility, but we are the force behind the changes in this exciting new industry. From what I've seen, some publishers are beginning to need us more than we need them."

**WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT AMAZON**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_59308840.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=13030) "Over the past week I've spoken to many people in and around the book business, and no-one has a good word to say about the e-tailer, even though some admit that as a business it is peerless. Amazon doesn't just want to eat our lunch, is the theory, it also wants to cook it and deliver it to us piping hot for a cost that is less than it would be if we did it ourselves.
But now that we have collectively woken up to the fact that we are all starring in what appears to be The Amazon Show, how do we find the EXIT?"

**COMPETING WITH AMAZON IS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO**

"Amazon’s execution has been a keystone of their success from the very beginning, from their invention (or at least early use) of a database for “discovery” even larger than their supply capabilities (they wanted the customer to know when a book they wanted was no longer available, so they could choose something else), promise dates for delivery that were almost always met, customer service that aggressively solved every problem, and intuitive navigation and execution that did for online retailing what Apple did with hardware and operating software."

**HOW AMAZON PLANS TO GIVE INDIE AUTHORS A LEG UP (HINT: THERE'S CASH INVOLVED)**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/amazonkindle150.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=13009)"Amazon really wants to attract more independent authors to its publishing platform. It also wants to add competitive muster to its Kindle Store for e-books and the new Kindle e-book lending library. In a move designed to achieve both goals, the company today announced the launch of KDP Select, a program that gives Kindle Direct Publishing authors an incentive to participate in Amazon's e-book lending initiative."

**SELF-PUBLISHING AND THE DEFINITION OF AN INDIE AUTHOR**

"It’s true that to many people self-publishing means bad quality books with no editing published by one of the vanity presses and the main concern is that this crap is flooding the world and readers can’t find quality in the mass of rubbish. I know these books do exist but I hope you agree that we can do a lot better than that these days. I also believe that readers are the new gatekeepers so sales online, reviews and rankings will ensure that the cream rises and bad stuff drops out of the picture.
The term ‘indie author’ has been increasingly claimed by authors who want a new label, one that does justice to the work involved."

**THE SEDUCTION OF SELF-PUBLISHING**

"I am, of course, a self-published author. I have six self-published books, all of which came out in the last year. Some are quite successful. Others, less so. None are total stinkers.
All of them increased my annual writer’s take-home by — *does some quick math* — 15-20%.
So, I’m for self-publishing. I think it’s a good idea.
…usually."

**MARGARET ATWOOD SAYS TWITTER, INTERNET BOOST LITERACY**

"A lot of people on Twitter are dedicated readers. Twitter is like all of the other short forms that preceded it. It's like the telegram. It's like the smoke signal. It's like writing on the washroom wall. It's like carving your name on a tree. It's a very short form and we use that very short form for very succinct purposes. There is a guy out there who is writing 140-character short stories — I just followed him today…but that's the exception. It's sort of like haikus [and] prose," Atwood said.

**ARE PUBLISHERS PUTTING THE SQUEEZE ON BLOGGERS?**

"Last month Sam Jordison asked here if broadsheet book reviews were "bland, boring and formulaic", and if books blogs offered an antidote to "chronically cautious newspapers". Now HarperCollins' American imprint William Morrow (home to authors including Michael Connelly, Neil Gaiman, Conn Iggulden … and the Kardashians) has set the books blogosphere on fire with a (possibly badly worded) letter laying out the terms and conditions under which they will now send books out to bloggers for review."

**PUBLISHERS WARM TO E-BOOKS ON THEIR OWN TERMS**

"Publishers have fought and won for now a key battle to keep pricing control over their titles, unlike the music industry, which a decade ago allowed Apple to impose a flat rate of $0.99 on music tracks in its iTunes store.
Penguin and Hachette told Reuters this week they were quite optimistic that e-books would help them increase profitability and reach bigger audiences, although they had not yet figured out how to sell digital extras to readers."
