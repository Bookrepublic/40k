Rhys Hughes, Paul Di Filippo.
__

_Paul Di Filippo is a famous American science fiction writer. He was a two-time finalist for the Nebula Award and a finalist for the Philip K. Dick. Paul is the author of _Wikiworld_ (you can read it in [english](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=11), [italian](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=14&product_id=30) and [portuguese](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=15&product_id=33))._

_Rhys is a welsh author. His fiction is both intellectual and hilarious with plenty of jokes, puns and satirical side-swipes to keep the reader constantly amused. You can read _The Astral Disruptor_ in [english](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=18) and in [italian](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=14&product_id=35)_.

**Rhys**: You  are a strong advocate of the themed or linked short-story  collection. I  imagine that any collection of discrete stories that  don't interact  with each other and carry forward some overarching  rationale feels like  indolence or cheating to you. Would you care to  elaborate on this?

[![Wikiworld - Paul Di Filippo - English version](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/wikiworld-difilippo_ok_t.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=11) **Paul**: This  policy of mine--reluctantly discarded over the past few years, as I  ran  out of sufficiently large groupings of self-similar stories to  reprint,  and issued two shamelessly generalist collections--was part  accidental  artifact of the marketplace, and part intentional.
After my  first book  of linked pieces appeared --[The Steampunk Trilogy](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/326917.The_Steampunk_Trilogy)-- I  immediately moved to  novel writing, following the known career path  that privileges longer  works. But I couldn't sell any of my efforts at  that length, yet could  place story collections, thanks to the  indulgence of my editor John  Oakes at Four Walls Eight Windows.  Wanting these book to have the  impact of a novel, and having an  abundance of unreprinted stories, I  started collating them by theme. I  think it was a smart move, in  retrospect, a way to stand out a bit in  the crowd. And indeed, when it  came time to make the shift to  omnivorous collections, it did feel like a  cheat!

**Rhys**: Just  like Brian Aldiss, Philip José Farmer, Barrington Bayley and  a handful  of others, you have never been afraid of cramming your  individual  stories with multiple ideas and playing concepts off against  each other.  Most writers of speculative fiction still strictly adhere  to the  one-idea-per-story aesthetic. Why are you in the minority in  this  regard?

**Paul**: Ever since  learning, decades ago, that the classic Beatles song "A Day  in the Life"  was the result of a mashup (long before that word had been  coined)  between separate songs by Lennon and McCartney, I have been a  fan of  jamming likely or unlikely concepts together to produce  something  stronger than would be obtained by lonely deployment of a  single idea.  It seems generous to both myself and the reader. And of  course within  each story there should be many telling speculative or  fantastical  details, even if not fully elaborated but just throwaway.
This stems  from the cyberpunk ethos of "eyekicks," as formulated by  Rudy Rucker. That term derives from the visual artists at the early  _Mad Magazine_,  people like Wally Wood or Will Elder or Harvey Kurtzman,  who would fill  each panel with tons of background silliness and  commentary not directly  related to the foreground action.

Generally,  I think that life itself is very thick--just reading a  daily newspaper  (does anyone but me still do that?) will provide a  model for the chaotic  rich soup of existence, with many things  happening simultaneously, that  an SF author--insofar as she or he is  seeking to write  "naturalistically--should seek to replicate.

I think initial imprinting on John Brunner's masterpiece [Stand on Zanzibar](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41069.Stand_on_Zanzibar) has been a factor in my writing as well.

**[![The Astral Disruptor - Rhys Hughes](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/astral-hughes_Eng_t.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=18)Rhys**: But  it's not only concepts that you mash together, play off against  each  other. You also seek to combine or fuse various styles of  storytelling:  differing forms, syntax, tone. Are you trying to create a  new prose  molecule that has different properties to the prose elements  that have  hitherto served writers?

**Paul**: It  is a mixed blessing and curse that I believe myself to possess no   essential core style. Perhaps the humorous tone in my [Plumage from Pegasus](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/729805.Plumage_from_Pegasus) pieces is as close to a default voice as I own. Like the   chameleonic Martian in the Bradbury story who reacted to the mixed   telepathic demands of the crowd of desperate humans and who was   subsequently torn apart by internal contradictions, I sometimes feel   that my literary path might be smoother if I could pick one mode/voice   and stick with it. However, I am unable to do so. I find that each   project invokes its own narrative persona that I must obey.
And, Rhys,   as you perceptively note, that distinct voice is not always only   singular, but a gestalt of sensory and ideational and aesthetic   impulses. It simply seems to me that we are all "large enough to   contain multitudes," as one of my heroes, Walt Whitman, famously   observed, and I just try to channel more of that onto the page perhaps   than other writers.

**Rhys**: Despite the similarities between Brunner's 'maximalism' in such novels as _Stand on Zanzibar_ and   your own urge to describe every opposing force in any scenario at  once,  I find your own style more enigmatic than his. You share his  clarity  but in your work there's a sense of something going on that the  reader  is only marginally aware of, a controlled obliqueness behind  the web of  forces, no matter how chaotic that web is. It's the sort of  thing  Cordwainer Smith did so well. And you do it too. Care to comment?

**Paul**: A  most kind and generous assessment, Rhys!  This multivalent, occult   ambiance you detec t--and which I strive for with varying degrees of   intentionality-- might be classically deemed "Pynchonesque."  I first   read [Gravity's Rainbow](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/415.Gravity_s_Rainbow) circa 1975, as an undergrad just learning there   was a realm of great literature beyond SF, and it blew my unformed mind. I sought to emulate the master most deliberately in my novel [Ciphers](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/729730.Ciphers),   with mixed results. But I think a little bit of Thomas Ruggles ends  up  in everything I do. This might be why Rudy Rucker and I collaborate  so  effortlessly, as he is a big Pynchon admirer as well.

And  of course, Sturgeon's famous prescription about imagining a  scene and  actions as thickly as possible, then transcribing only a  fraction of  relevant details, which will nevertheless magically evoke a  scene of  similar though not identical heft in the reader's mind, also  comes into  play somehow here.

**Rhys**: Capitalism  is the default political setting of the modern individual  human being?  What about a future world inhabited solely by robots?  What kind of  political system would prevail there?

**[![Wikiworld - Paul Di Filippo - Italian version](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/wikiworld-difilippo_it_t.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=14&product_id=30)Paul**: I  have been fascinated by all-robot societies ever since I read Brian   Aldiss's "[Who Can Replace a Man?](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1876500.Who_Can_Replace_a_Man_)", around age twelve.  But I have   only written two free-standing stories in that vein. In the first,   "Providence," robot society is organized around commerce in remnant   vinyl LP records. Don't ask me to justify this now, but I think the   reader will buy it for the duration of the story. More recently, I   dared to work in the canon of one of my other heroes, Stanislaw Lem, by   writing "The New Cyberiad," which takes his nearly omnipotent robot   tinkerers on a new adventure involving time-travel, the construction of   artificial planets, and the recreation of the extinct human race.   Lem's  robots are motivated by idle curiosity and less savory human  emotions,  but existing without need for commerce or work, they can  indulge their  whims in much more grandiose fashion than we can.

In  my novel [Fuzzy Dice](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7283034-fuzzy-dice) I offer a brief glimpse of a robot hell,  where  robots have exterminated all organic life.  The secret behind  some of  this portrait is a great little book called [Legal Daisy Spacing](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1568294.Legal_Daisy_Spacing), which  portrays an insane brand of terraforming.  Grab a copy  whenever you see  one!

**[![Il disgregatore astrale - Rhys Hughes](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/astral-hughes_It_t1.png)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=14&product_id=35)Rhys**: Like you I was also blown away by Thomas Pynchon when I was younger, and in fact my discovery of his first novel _V_ changed   my attitude to fiction forever. One of the many things about Pynchon   that impressed me so much was his enormous erudition, the fact that his   novels were stuffed with obscure historical facts concerning eccentric   people, arcane conspiracy theories and odd incidents, the sort of   material that often ends up as footnotes in academic texts but in his   hands was perfectly integrated into the dynamic of the story itself. So   in _The Crying of Lot 49_,  for instance, we learn about the  very first occasion when the USA and  Russia came to blows, an event so  shrouded in obscurity that I still  don't know whether it's true or  fictional. Before the days of the  internet and casual search engine  use, such details were astoundingly  difficult to research, but now such  information is easy to access. How  much of the mystique of erudtion  has been eroded by Google? And how does  this relate to your own  research for your own fiction?

**Paul**: Pynchon  definitely set the gold standard prior to the internet for  maximalist,  insanely erudite fiction. In his introduction to his story  collection [Slow Learner](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5814.Slow_Learner) he reaffirms that in the internet age such a  task is still  worth doing even if easier. I myself have now written  several  stories --[Wikiworld](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=11), _Murder In Geektopia_-- which were essentially  composed  in three screen windows:  the word processor, and two browser  windows,  one open to Google and one to Wikipedia. Lou Anders, editor  for _Murder In Geektopia_, suggested, with a hint of irony, that the  subsequent story  could only be read in such a fashion!

But the  ease of finding obscure information has really done nothing,  I believe,  to allow the average writer to emulate Pynchon.  It's all  in the vision,  the selectivity, the ability to draw interesting  connections. These  talents are as rare as ever. I am reminded of the  great Talking Heads  song _Thank You for Sending Me an Angel_: "You can  walk, you can talk  just like me... but I'll walk circles around you!"

**Rhys**: C.S.  Lewis once said that, "To tell how odd things struck odd people  is to  have an oddity too much". Most writers of 'imaginative  literature' have  followed this rule, but Brian Aldiss in his _Trillion Year Spree_ wrote   that the works of Samuel Delany consistently showed how that rule  could  be broken, with astounding results. Just like Delany, you also   constantly break that rule. What are you views on this?

**Paul**: I  have always violated this overly cautious Lewis proscription, and   always shall. Estrangement is the heart and soul of SF, and the   stranger the better! Beginning writers especially are way too cautious.

**Rhys**: Do you regard yourself as optimistic or pessimistic about the future?

**Paul**: I  am innately optimistic in my personal life, and consequently also in  my  fiction. I think it's a legacy of growing up in the Sixties, which   were somehow both apocalyptic and utopian. I don't really believe that   we live in special times or conditions.  (Isn't that a postulate of   science too, that our corner of the spacetime continuum is typical,   rather than special?) I take a Mr. Natural viewpoint:  "'Twas ever   thus!"  The human condition is an eternal tragicomedy, and yet somehow   the audience always exits the theater in reasonable shape, a little   bloody yet unbowed, and returns for more!
