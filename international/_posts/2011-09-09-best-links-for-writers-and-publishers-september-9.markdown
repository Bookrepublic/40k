**THE ARTICLE EVERYONE WHO LOVES BOOKS SHOULD READ**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/cn_image.size_.third-ebook-bookbiz.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=11520)"The value of Geffen’s e-book is its breadth. For anyone with an interest in writing and/or publishing, no matter which aspect, you’ll find a solid foundation of information in How a Book Is Born. You’ll learn things like how indie booksellers have more influence than ever before, as well as being provided with huge amounts of relevant figures (agents can receive 70 queries per week; acquiring editors get 10 agented submissions per week). It’s not exactly groundbreaking journalism, but the piece is full of information anyone outside the industry (and many within) would find useful."

**DISAPPEARING INK. READERS HAVE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD BUT PUBLISHERS NEED TO ADAPT BETTER**

"They also need to become more efficient. Digital books can be distributed globally, but publishers persist in dividing the world into territories with separate editorial staffs. In the digital age it is daft to take months or even years to get a book to market. And if they are to distinguish their wares from self-published dross, they must get better at choosing books, honing ideas and polishing copy. If publishers are to hold readers’ attention they must tell a better story—and edit out all the spelling mistakes as well."

**THE SHAPE OF OUR FUTURE BOOK**

"So I asked myself — how does one view the emotional weight of books in the context of our current excitement? And in asking myself this I found an image growing in my mind over the last few months. As I was doing the work of “now,” this image of the “past” grew stronger. That image manifested as a story — an imagined myth of the history of the book, converging with reality around the turn of the 20th century."

**WRITERS: SOCIAL MEDIA IS A TOOL - NOT A MAGIC BULLET**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/blogshakespearecomic.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=11503)"If you want to make more money writing for a living — or quit your day job to write full-time — then you need to look inside the media toolbox and see each type of social media for what it is: a tool. Not a magic bullet. Not a sure-fire path to fame and fortune. You also need to realize that social media can’t be your entire media plan. And no, you are not the exception, Internet Boy."

**BOB MEYER: PUBLISHING IS THE WILD WEST - DANGER, BUT POSSIBILITY TOO**

"I received an email from an editor in Italy who publishes some of my books responding to a question I’d asked: What was the state of e-publishing in his country? He replied that it was like a Sergio Leone movie where all the publishers were standing in the street with their hands hovering over their pistols, but they were all afraid to draw first."

**"DON'T EXPECT CHANGE TO BE EASY. CHANGE IS HARD. BUT IT'S WORTHWHILE."**

"Writers couldn’t get to readers without going through the editors and sales force. And that’s a finite group who must use their expertise to decide if a book will make a profit for the company or not.

What is that expertise? Experience, yes. A love of reading, yes. And mostly a lot of guesswork. That’s the dirty secret of publishing. Editors, the sales force, and the publishers get surprised by a book selling better than expected more often than they get the actual sales figures right. In fact, most profit-and-loss statements developed on a book before publication are wrong."

**IT'S THE MIDLIST AUTHORS [...] THAT ARE THE SAVVIEST AUTHORS NOW**

"Business people. Listen to your tech people—since they seem to be the ones dominating all the panels in the industry, but also listen to your content providers and more importantly, your readers. Understand that my Infantry maxim holds true for you: Lead, follow or get the hell out of the way. Readers don’t care if a book is published by Random House or a goat. They just care if the book is good. Understand your days in the captain’s quarters on the Titanic are over. You don’t control distribution any more. But you can still captain a ship. It’s just not the Titanic."
