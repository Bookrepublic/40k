![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/quote1.jpg) _«Kobo sees Reading Life as the beginning of a new era for the company and for e-reading, one where adding elements of community to the reading experience not only helps Kobo differentiate itself from rival e-book offerings from Amazon.comInc., Google Inc. and Apple Inc., but potentially opens the door to new partnerships and marketing opportunities to entice book lovers and create fresh revenue streams. "This is the beginning of a major thrust for us, where we're making e-reading social," Kobo chief executive Michael Serbinis said in an interview.
The most important part that we believe customers are looking for in the overall experience is the cultural part of reading. The cultural part of reading is social, it's fun and it's what makes content meaningful.»_
