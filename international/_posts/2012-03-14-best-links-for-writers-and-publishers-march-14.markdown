**PUBLISHING CAN BE THE ENGINE OF THE ENGAGEMENT ECONOMY**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Schermata-2012-03-14-a-17.11.56.png)](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Schermata-2012-03-14-a-17.11.56.png)"In the following interview, O'Leary addresses issues of — and solutions for — content abundance from the viewpoint of publishers as well as consumers. He argues that the increasing numbers of non-readers, people who don't engage with content, "represent a threat not just to publishing, but to the way we function as a country, an economy and as a part of a world order." It is the responsibility of the publishing industry, O'Leary says, to reposition itself as the "engine of the engagement economy.""

**FOR MANY AUTHORS, PUBLISHING IS AN IDEOLOGY, WHILE FOR ME IT'S A BUSINESS**

"But I’ve discovered that not all authors find my message so awesome at all, and I think there are a few reasons for their reticence. First, with choice comes responsibility, and many people are comfortable with a lack of choice precisely because that lack confers the luxury of avoiding the responsibility that comes with choice. So when I say, “You have a choice!”, many authors hear, “Now you are going to be responsible for the outcome!” And they don’t like that."

**EBOOKS AND LIBRARIES: IS IT WORTH THE EFFORT?**

"Since publishers are so concerned with the “perpetuity of lending and simultaneity of availability” of their ebooks, I have to wonder if libraries shouldn’t just help them out and hit the STOP button themselves?
Stop buying ebooks across the board, at any price, under any terms. Let publishers fight it out with Amazon, and when the dust finally settles (it will) and a viable business model appears (maybe), begin negotiating anew, on solid ground, with whomever’s left standing.
In the meantime, libraries can redirect those precious resources and finances being flagged for ebooks towards more tangible initiatives in their respective communities."

**THE END OF LIMITS: GUEST POST BY MATTHEW IDEN**

"The chatter swirling around e-publishing these days seems to center around monopolies, royalty rates, and the end of traditional publishing as an industry. But digital publishing isn’t just toppling Big Six publishing (heh) or re-indexing price points, it’s redefining the craft of writing by giving authors unprecedented control over the presentation of their material in one potentially game-changing venue: length. From six word short stories to million word mega-novels, e-publishing is opening doors of creativity and knocking down antiquated legacy word count requirements. A basic fundamental about writing as a craft is being…well, rewritten and we are now in the age of the end. The end of limits, that is."

**THE SECRET HANDSHAKE OF SUCCESSFUL DIGITAL PUBLISHING**

"Three years from now, the only people making a living writing are going to be the ones who keep producing quality content not the ones who tweet, blog, Facebook, Pinterest, hit a gopher with a stick. That isn’t to say that no promotion is required, but its not the main ingredient in successful digital publishing.
While discoverability is key in digital publishing, sustainability trumps it. And sustainability comes from consistent, great content that your readers love."
