Yes, man, we're looking for you. Do you like Sci-fi, intimate, dreamlike stories? Than you can be interested on our offer: a call for reviewers. Here're titles we're interested to listen your opinion about:

**KEEPSAKES**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Ricordi_Resnick_Eng_t1.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=8560)This intense short sci-fi novel by Mike Resnkic, recently nominated for the Hugo (and it is his 35th time!), is about an alien race _that comes like a plague_, helping people and pretending an heavy price back. So heavy that someone has to investigate about: but what they're going to discover is that not everything, of course, is as clear and certain as it seems.
