![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Publishing1.jpg)_ Nathan Bransford, "By the Time A Self-Published Author Hits it Big, Do They Really Need a Publisher?"_

"This post title has been sitting in my Draft file for months, well before the news broke that self-publishing star John Locke inked a [print-only deal](http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/simon-schuster-to-handle-sales-distribution-for-john-locke-print-books_b36824)with Simon & Schuster, choosing to continue to self-publish his own e-books.

For now, self-published authors absolutely do need publishers in some form if they want to hit it really big because publishers can get print books into bookstores. But as the John Locke deal demonstrates, they don't necessarily need them to publish the e-books, and in fact, in many if not most cases the authors would prefer to hang onto e-book rights themselves.

And this is a major challenge for publishers as we move forward into a primarily e-book world: By the time a self-published author hits it big will they really need a publisher?

Let's revise that: In an e-book world, by the time _any_ author hits it big will they really need a publisher?"
