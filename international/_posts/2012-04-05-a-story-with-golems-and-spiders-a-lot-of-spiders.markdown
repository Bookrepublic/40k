It was nominated for a Nebula Award and reprinted in Ellen Datlow’s anthology The Best Horror of the Year Volume One.

**THE STORY**

“The story begins when a golem bursts into the office of our hero and deposits a girl on the carpet. Unfortunately, she’s in pieces. 11,395 of them to be precise.

The big question is – did the golem do it? The only way to find out for sure is get the girl back together again. But that could be trickier than you think. Especially if you don’t like spiders.” [Graham Edwards]

**THE STRING CITY MYSTERIES**

"A hard-boiled private investigator with a talent for twisting dimensions … a beautiful dame … a changeling baby made of wood … the perfect ingredients for the first of my String City Mysteries, a series of fantasy noir detective romps due to be published by 40k Books throughout 2012.

I wrote _The Wooden Baby_ immediately after devouring a Dashiell Hammett anthology. I’m not the first to mix up the fantasy and detective genres, but it’s such a juicy collision I can’t resist it. Later stories in the series explore the strange city where my nameless gumshoe lives, but this first adventure just places him in an anonymous office in the middle of, apparently, nowhere.

_The Wooden Baby_ by Graham Edwards was first published in the April 2005 edition of [Realms of Fantasy](http://www.rofmag.com/)."

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

"I was changing the filter on the coffee-machine when two tons of wet clay crashed through my office door. The clay was wearing a yellow municipal jacket and dragging a garbage can. The clay was eight feet tall and bright like a satsuma. The clay was a golem.

«I thought you apes took the garbage out,» I said, clipping the coffee filter back."
