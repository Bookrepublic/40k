> 
> Storm, the protagonist of the last Paul Di Filippo's story, is not human, as you can realize thanks to his furry appearance, but he has been created by humans.
> 
> When the same species that bring him to life destroyed his family during a bloody battle, he felt not only astonished and angry, but also confused about his identity and his origin.
> 
> In search of himself, Storm begins a long trip that leads him to explore the bioregion around a volcano - full of strange and smart creatures - and to deal with the globally distributed artificial intelligence, who appears like “a kindly sorceror from some old human epic”. This weird figure ask him to join a mission with other ten guardians that helps Storm to understand that it doesn't matter where are you from, the most important thing is where are you going.
