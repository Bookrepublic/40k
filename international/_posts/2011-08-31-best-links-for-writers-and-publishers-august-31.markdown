**WHO HAS THE POWER IN PUBLISHING?**

_A Dialog Between J.A. Konrath & Blake Crouch  
_"**Joe: **Sure, you could self-pub. But you'd pay a fortune for sub-standard books that were non-returnable--or if they were returnable, you ended up with 3000 books in your garage because they were too expensive and the cover art was terrible. So bookstores wouldn't stock your book, and if they did, it probably wouldn't sell. Before ebooks, self-publishing was basically a one-way ticket to epic faildom.  
**Blake: **Then along came Kindle, the first runaway hit in the ebook revolution. A few things made this momentous..."

**BY THE TIME A SELF-PUBLISHED AUTHOR HITS IT BIG, DO THEY REALLY NEED A PUBLISHER?**

For publishers, here's the nightmare publishing path for authors of the future: Author signs with traditional publisher for first book, author hits it big, author says thankyouverymuch I got this now and self-publishes from then on out.

**HOW READERS BECOME ADDICTS: THE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND**

![v](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/aaaaa.jpg)As a writer raised by Economists, I have some perspective that others don’t have, and maybe don’t want. (There’s a reason it’s called the dismal science after all.) But when approaching the question of how to price an e-book, sound economic theory (not that macroeconomic crap that everybody is currently lying their ass off about) can lend some interesting perspective.  
_Price vs. Cost. _A price is only part of what a good or service costs you. Especially a book. In the economic sense, the true cost of something is what you give up to have or consume it. In the case of the book, you spend some money on the book, but the bulk of the cost is in the time you spend reading it. So _book price + time cost = the true cost of the book.

**WHY "LOOK INSIDE" IS A BETTER SOLUTION FOR iOS USERS THAN CLOUD READER**

The basic problem iOS users have is that they can’t buy books from within Kindle application any longer. I’ve always argued that majority of such purchases were made from _Buy Now_ links at the end of free samples, not Kindle Store button at the top right of home screen. Why that? If you’ve opened the ereading application, you don’t want to look for new books, but you want to continue reading, for example when you’ve finished a free sample.  
_Look Inside_ solves the problem of free samples in a much better way than Cloud Reader. Let’s have a look.

**3 THINGS THAT COME FIRST BEFORE YOU TACKLE SOCIAL MEDIA**

One of the most common questions I receive is: How can I use XYZ social media tool to market and promote my book?  
Sometimes I feel like I’m being asked: How can I find Mr. or Mrs. Right who will make me happy for the rest of my life?  
So many factors are at play, and one of the most critical is how interesting you are to other people. You might very well start by asking yourself, “What makes me interesting?”

**THE KINDLE BECOMES INTERACTIVE**

****Amazon has added a feature for the Kindle's readers that also poses interesting future scenarios for advertisers, should the format be expanded.  
In the immediate term, the new feature - which lets readers ask questions of participating authors as they are reading the books - will likely boost the e-reader's popularity.

**THE FUTURIST'S DILEMMA**

****This is the futurist's dilemma: Any believable prediction will be wrong. Any correct prediction will be unbelievable. Either way, a futurist can't win. He is either dismissed or wrong.
