![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/quote1.jpg)«_The one forecast I've seen consistently since that time is that the publishing industry will soon suffer a gruesome death. On this one, I disagree. The lightning fast pace of change makes it more exciting than ever to be in the publishing business. Scary for many, but you don't get thrills without suspense.
Whatever happens, I'm confident in making one prediction; readers will continue to crave great stories from writers. It's how they will read those tales that is suddenly hard to predict._»

The key factor is findability. Findability is about designing systems that help readers find the book they want to read.
