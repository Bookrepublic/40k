**IF PRINT BOOKS ARE LIMPING TOWARD EXTINCTION...**

"Here’s a question that doesn’t get asked often enough in the “death of print” debate. If print books are limping toward extinction, why do so many writers—even the youngest, Web-savviest writers—still fight to publish them?"
[Austin Allen](http://bigthink.com/ideas/40313)

**THE PROBLEM WITH DEEP DISCOUNT EBOOK DEALS**

![Joe Wikert](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/photo_joew_m.jpg)"I admit it. I check Amazon's Kindle Daily Deal every day. Every single day. Why? As a publisher I'm curious to see what they're offering and as a consumer I don't want to miss out on a great deal. (In the spirit of full disclosure, at O'Reilly Media we offer an ebook or video deal of the day too. In fact, our program was in place long before Amazon started theirs. Everything I'm about to say below pertains not only to Amazon's program but O'Reilly's and everyone else's as well.)"

**WHEN PUBLISHERS ARE THEIR OWN WORST ENEMY**

"Publishers become their own worst enemy when they ask what is the market for a particular product. You can’t ask that question for new ventures; it only has a meaningful answer when a market has already been established. There is another step, an earlier step, in the process, and this is where publishers have been negligent.  What kind of new capability can I create? If the capability has inherent interest, I will figure out a business model and create a new market for it later. This was ably summed up by Tim O’Reilly when he proposed that the goal is to create more value than you capture."

**BEYOND THE BOOK**

"Book publisher HarperCollins announced yesterday that it will make around 5000 of its books available for on-demand printing.
[...] the remaining brick and mortar bookstores, could use this technology to keep a watchful eye on inventory. They can probably use the extra space on the bookshelves to sell you all sorts of things, tablets computers, cell phones, or maybe just socks! Yeah, imagine a bookstore filled with tube socks. You’d like that."

**GOING IT ALONE: 6 REASONS TO SELF-PUBLISH YOUR NOVEL**

"Nobody said the life of a writer would be easy, but it must be a shock to every indie author’s system to finish the final page of their novel and realize that the work has only just begun!  Never have there been so many decisions to be made in such a short space of time, ranging from which editor to use to whether or not to hire a cover designer or try and produce your own artwork.  Forget being a writer; you’ll need to become a master marketer, a superb salesman, and a networker extraordinaire!  And somehow, in and among all this, you’ll need to be working on your second book to ensure that all the interest you generate doesn’t ebb away over time."

**A WRITERS' BILL OF RIGHTS OF THE DIGITAL AGE**

"Writers and publishers are continuously facing a changing landscape.  The Writers’ Union of Canada has developed 12 core demands for the digital age. Interesting list for authors in negotiations with their publishers."

**GETTING GOOD AT GOODREADS**

"For the past year, I have been a not-so-good member of Goodreads. I’ve had exactly one book on my shelf, which was shown as “in progress” for the entirety of that time (I hope no one who stumbled upon my profile really thought “Freedom” was causing me that much trouble). But last week, I was inspired to action by the announcement that Goodreads had launched its much anticipated “Netflix for Books” recommendation system, the product of a “secret sauce” of proprietary algorithms and twenty billion data points, culled from six million registered users and a hundred and ninety million books (the recipe formerly belonged to the site Discovereads, which Goodreads bought in March)."
