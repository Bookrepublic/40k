A Green Knight (or is that a Knightess?) needs a PI to find her missing husband. Our Gumshoe gets the job of tracking down the charming Robert du Chasse. It also leads him back to one of the serious loves of his life. The trail leads to Robert who is holed up in a guest house in Little Carthage. But it’s not long before a gunman bullet-holes the guest house and the PI finds his services are surplus to requirement. Is his only hope to spill the beans on Robert’s love life?

**THE STRING CITY MYSTERIES**

"A hard-boiled private investigator with a talent for twisting dimensions … a beautiful dame … a changeling baby made of wood … the perfect ingredients for the first of my String City Mysteries, a series of fantasy noir detective romps due to be published by 40k Books throughout 2012.

I wrote _The Wooden Baby_ immediately after devouring a Dashiell Hammett anthology. I’m not the first to mix up the fantasy and detective genres, but it’s such a juicy collision I can’t resist it. Later stories in the series explore the strange city where my nameless gumshoe lives, but this first adventure just places him in an anonymous office in the middle of, apparently, nowhere.

_The Wooden Baby_ by Graham Edwards was first published in the April 2005 edition of [Realms of Fantasy](http://www.rofmag.com/)."

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

«She came in out of the rain, a grown woman no higher than my knee. I kept my feet on the desk and the coffee cup at my lips – I’ve seen stranger things in this city than little women. But there was something else. She was green. “I’m looking for a private investigator,” the little green dame said. “Guess you found one,” I replied. “Are you what I think you are?” She smiled, revealing sharp teeth the colour of limes. “Can’t say,” she said. “What d’you think I am?”

I put the coffee cup on the desk, my feet on the floor. I followed my feet with my knees and hands, brought my eyes level with hers. She stared me down like a minor goddess, and that was what clinched it. “You’re a Green Knight,” I said, “aren’t you?” “Good enough,” she replied. “I guess you’re hired.”»
