  «At one occasion when my mother and I were traveling, she happened to notice an iPad-like device that a man sitting next to us was using. When she inquired, I corrected her saying that it was the Amazon Kindle in his hands. Intrigued by the concept of a dedicated device for reading books, she asked me more about the device. I explained to her about the e-ink display technology on e-book readers like the Kindle, that look just like printed paper and deliver amazing battery life. It was then that I decided to gift her the Kindle on Christmas, until I changed my mind a few days back.»
