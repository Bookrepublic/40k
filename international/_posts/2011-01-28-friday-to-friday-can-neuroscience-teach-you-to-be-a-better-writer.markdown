«_I found myself quoting it repeatedly for several weeks after reading it._»
[K. Okada]

«_If you read or write, or if you are simply curious, you will enjoy reading (and rereading) this essay._»
[Michael Power]

«_I found this very interesting and the more we learn about this, the more writers could change the way they produce stories.
Fascinating read - that's the best way I can describe it._»
[Clarissa Draper]

**Can neuroscience teach you to be a better writer?**

«Hmm», wrote Alan Rinzler, «Intrigued, I phoned up Livia in Cambridge to ask if writers could really  manipulate readers’ brains so their books might have greater success.» Here you can find [the interview](http://www.alanrinzler.com/blog/2009/12/07/lighting-up-your-reader%E2%80%99s-brain-can-neuroscience-teach-you-to-be-a-better-writer/).

**Too Technical? Not at all!**

And, if it all sounds too technical, don't worry!
As Victoria Pantazis says, «Blackburne seems to have achieved the difficult task of conveying the  neurology and science of reading and interpreting what we read in a way  that's simple while making me want to keep reading!»

**The next pop science publishing phenomenon?**
