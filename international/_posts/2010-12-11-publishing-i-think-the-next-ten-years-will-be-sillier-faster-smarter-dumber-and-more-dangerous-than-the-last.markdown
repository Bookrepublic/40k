  «I think the Next Ten years will be sillier, faster, smarter, dumber and more dangerous than the last. I don't think you can shrink global volatility so fast. I think the swings will just get wilder between boom and bust before we have no choice but to slow down.
  

I liked this article from David Pogue on [The Last Ten Years](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/25/technology/personaltech/25pogue.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1). I also like Michael Vassar's post on the next ten years.
  

I am going to put together some Stocktwits interviews with my favorite brains forcing them to think about the next TEN years with me before years end as well. Who would you like me to talk to for us?»
