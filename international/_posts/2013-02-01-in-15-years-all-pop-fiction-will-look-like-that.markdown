[!["LOVE IS STRANGE", Bruce Sterling](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/liscover.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ASBPAWY) «It’s a weird, lumpy, sometimes uncomfortable comedy,» says [Warren Ellis](http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=14575), in his review of [Love Is Strange](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ASBPAWY), the new novel by Bruce Sterling.

«It is the best and only romance novel you should read this year.»

Best sellers, comics, television, sociocultural commentaries about transhumanist themes, he is a deep analyst of [the future of pop culture](http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=13492).

[Love Is Strange](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ASBPAWY) is really strange, or better: «is one peculiar fucking book».

«*Aw c'mon Warren,» tweets Bruce Sterling, «it's weird NOW, in 15 years all pop fiction will look like that.»
