**5 EXCELLENT TIPS FOR PLATFORM BUILDING**

"I really loved this piece of encouragement from Rusty Shelton, on your approach to social media or online engagement. So true!! "Don't start everywhere at once. Start with what you truly enjoy. Pick 1 thing and try it for a little while, and if you're not really enjoying it, look to something different. Otherwise, you won't find time (it'll feel like work).""

**WHY SELLING E-BOOKS AT 99 CENTS DESTROYS MINDS**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/chadpost.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9590)"So, you have an e-reader, you’re bored with TV and all your video games, ain’t feeling the Facebook, and want a book. Why pay $12.99 for “entertainment” when you could buy a John Locke thriller for $0.99? I have no answer to that question. Seriously. And this has always been my problem with e-books: they emphasize immediate entertainment — and gratification — over real “reading,” which takes more commitment, patience, attention and time."

**THE ROLE OF BLOGGING IN DIGITAL AND INDIE PUBLISHING**

"“A blog is a relationship with your readers and your readers are ultimately your fan base. Your blog needs to be focused and must be interesting. You might even find that writing worthwhile blog posts to reach out to potential readers is harder than the work of writing your book in the first place,” remarks Penelope Trunk, top career advice blogger and bestselling author of Brazen Careerist: The New Rules for Success."

**THE TERRIFYING TRUTH ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGY**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Schermata-2011-06-14-a-12.26.42.png)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9591)"The fear of the never-ending onslaught of gizmos and gadgets is nothing new. The radio, the telephone, Facebook—each of these inventions changed the world. Each of them scared the heck out of an older generation. And each of them was invented by people who were in their 20s. Mark Zuckerberg didn't create Facebook for people with kids and mortgages. Technology is created by the young, for the young. The young revel in new gadgets with small, deft thumbs. They beg for them in acronym-laden speeches because OMG, you need this stuff to be cool IRL. Then they use them to take lewd pictures of themselves, even though this is obviously a very bad idea. They are the fearless ones. Why are the young able to thrive, tossing away instruction manuals and digging in with reckless abandon?"

**THE PUBBED WRITER'S 7 DEADLY SINS**

"I’ve collected some of my own missteps here, but I also reached out to one of my favorite author communities–Fiction Writers Co-Op–to round out the list. If you’re unpublished, learn these lessons now and save yourself some grief later; and if you’re published and doing any of these things, take heed."

**BOOKS, ARTIFACTUALLY AND ANECDOTALLY SPEAKING...**

"Anecdotally speaking ....... it seems to me that the artifactual and design elements of print books are coming more to the fore, albeit in different ways. As the use of ebooks grows this is not really surprising, as this change creates niche opportunities for experiences focused specifically on the possibilities of the print medium. Some related trends are interesting. First, we are seeing physical books repurposed, recycled, or 'upcycled' to perform other functions. Second, we are seeing a focus on the aesthetics of print books, and on book arts in general. And third, we are seeing - I think? - more interest in artists' books, in books as art, ... "

**MAN VS. WOMAN VS. HUMAN**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/man-woman-paper.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9592)"How about the more subtle gender expectations that we find in books, especially if one gender is writing about the other? For many years women said (largely where men couldn’t hear) that men couldn’t write believable women, beginning with Christine de Pizan, who argued in 1402 that the women in Jean de Meun’s mega-hit Roman de la Rose didn’t actually talk that way, or think that way—the romance was nothing but a vehicle to slander women. This was like an Internet flamewar. Apparently pretty much all of literate Europe got involved."

**AWARENESS AND WRITING**

"If we look at where we stood one hundred years ago, socially, economically, politically, racially, everything, and where we stand today, there is a clear trajectory. Upward mobility is being opened to more and more people. Formerly restricted groups are now able to step into roles that were once considered impossible. It’s not at all perfect and wonderful and harmonious now (oh no, not even remotely) but there is a clear path, and that path is going up, so long as we continue to walk it. And yet, as I said, our stories don’t show that. I so often see stories of a Young White Male (Aged Nineteen to Forty Five) who is Obviously Our Hero. Any women in the story exist to be Looked At, Lusted Over, and then Won As A Trophy. If somebody has a skin color that isn’t white, Lord help them, because the author won’t. Do you write like this? Because, I’ll tell you what… I know I used to. And — this hurts to admit, but I must be honest — I know I still do. When this is the only story you have ever heard, ever read, ever seen… it is the only story you know how to write. There are two parts to solving this problem [...]"

**9 FICTIONAL SCIFI DRUGS WE WISH WERE REAL**

"In our modern world, drugs are everywhere, but are limited in what they can do. However, in the world of sci-fi, any drug you can imagine can exist. Let's take a look at the made-up drugs that we all wish would be real. Ask your doctor if any of these drugs are right for you."
