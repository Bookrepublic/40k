**HOW PUBLISHERS CAN STAY IN THE GAME**

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/its-the-authors-how-publishers-can-stay-in-the-game.jpeg) "Friedman rightly focuses on the changing author-publisher relationship as a key shift affecting the role and importance of publishers. For reasons we’re all becoming familiar with, the balance of power in this relationship is moving strongly in the direction of authors who are feeling newly-empowered by the opportunities and new partners who can help connect them to their readers.
These shifts in the market are making it much easier for new players to compete with traditional publishers for those authors."

**SELF PUBLISHING: SECOND CLASS NO MORE?**

"Another strong indicator of shifting power, and arguably one of the reasons authors have been able to assume greater control: not all successful self-publishers sign on the dotted line. Savvy authors consider their options and choose the publishing method that best meets their career objectives or their goals for a particular project. Ruth Cardello, author of the runaway bestseller "Bedding the Billionaire," a shining example of an author taking her career into her own hands, recently turned down a lucrative publishing deal. «I estimated how much my books were likely to make over the next four years and compared that to the deal I was offered,” she says. “When I crunched the numbers, the decision was easy.»"

**REVEALING THE BUSINESS OF EBOOKS**

"A reporter for the tablet device industry recently posed the question: “Can the publishing industry adapt to follow the online trend fueled by eBooks’ rise, or is it too old and archaic to function in a high-tech society?” According to the data from the 4th Annual eBook Survey of Publishers, the answer is a resounding yes. The publishing industry can adapt and is adapting at an increasingly fast pace, as year-over-year survey results prove."

**WHERE ARE THE READERS FOR SELF-PUBLISHED E-BOOKS?**

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_91058507.jpeg) "Hocking wrote a series of fantasy novels and was one of the first authors to successfully utilize social networking to sell her wares. It worked; she sold tens of thousands of books and developed a huge following. When the offer came from a traditional publisher and she saw all the zeroes behind the dollar sign she jumped at it (and I may well have done the same thing).

Howey’s situation was different. His “Wool” series of short stories caught fire. He self-published his first one and reader interest propelled it to the top of Amazon’s bestseller lists. When readers demanded more, he wrote four other installments and they’re still selling at a ferocious pace, every day. It goes to show that with a good product and a bit of good fortune readers will find your book and they’ll tell others too. Unfortunately, Howey is the exception. Most self-published or indie authors have to work at finding the elusive reader."

**BOOKS AS SOUVENIRS OF THE DIGITAL READING EXPERIENCE: ANOTHER CASE FOR BUNDLING**

"There are those who argue that readers aren’t clamoring for bundled books yet. Of course, music lovers weren’t clamoring for an iPod either, and happily carted their CDs and tape collections with them until something entirely better and more convenient came along, allowing them to carry their entire music collection in their pocket. And yes, there will be continued concerns expressed about appropriate pricing models, about the technological requirements of bundling at retail sites, about the potential of devaluing one format or another."

**GREAT REASONS TO SELF-PUBLISH: 7 CASE HISTORIES**

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/SatisfactionGuaranteed.jpeg) "Writing and publishing a book can strike an emotional chord of meaning and importance for the author that is rewarding beyond expectation.
Some experience the profound satisfaction of leaving a family legacy, or finally making sense of life experiences, or raising public awareness about a serious issue. Publishing your own book can also make sense financially and strategically for business purposes, as many writers have found.
Here are seven great reasons to self-publish with case histories from authors I’ve worked with."
