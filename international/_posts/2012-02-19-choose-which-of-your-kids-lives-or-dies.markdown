Imagine a world where the government controls the population growth and the environmental resources through an insane and cynical mechanism of compensation. Offenders are treated as criminals, used in community services or worse, depending on the severity of the transgressions. A young mother is forced to choose which of her newborn twins to sacrifice: the risk of pain is unimaginable.

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

"The message that the nurse’s scent proclaimed was, «I haven’t contributed to population pollution. I can afford little luxuries like this that are so much less resource-hoggish than popping out termies, dearie.»
Nina tried to ignore the sadistic little message of the perfume. She made a move to touch the boys’ faces—the only parts of them exposed to the filtered air besides their incredibly tiny fingers and toes—but the nurse jerked the cart away with a scowl.
«What the hell do you think you’re doing, Nina?» Bucky yanked her by the left shoulder back against the pillows. «The rule is no touching till after you’ve chosen.»"
