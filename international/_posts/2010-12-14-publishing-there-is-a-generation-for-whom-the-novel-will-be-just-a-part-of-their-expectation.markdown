  «The Novel (capital T, capital N) is not under threat from this technology, people will always love to read, nothing beats it - we all know that. But there is a generation for whom the novel will be just a part of their expectation from their favourite author, or a new author. They will want to know more, to be friends on Facebook, to follow them on Twitter, and they will expect interesting, updating content on their mobile devices which lifts the novel and its creator off the page and into the full-colour, multi-media real world. It's a medium which suits a new kind of writer; multi-taskers, collaborators, technology enthusiasts, the connected.
  

The way the publishing world is embracing this new platform is in stark contrast to how the music industry reacted to new technology changing its business model, and I think that where they failed and lost their way, publishing will adapt and strengthen and will play a defining role in this technology's development. Just don't ask me to deliver it in 3D.»

Interesting post. Worth reading, even if you disagree.
