We are incredibly saddened by the news of the passing of Daniel Pearlman. Professor of creative writing, short story and fantasy fiction writer, he passed away at the age of 77.

We would like to remember him for his wonderful stories and great sense of humor, that will be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with his wife and daughter at this sad time.
