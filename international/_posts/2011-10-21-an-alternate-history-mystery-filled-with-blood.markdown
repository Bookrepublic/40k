**FIRST REACTIONS**

"Not just an alternate history book, but also a mystery thriller, Redchapel is like a trip that leads the reader into a dark place where Roosevelt's investigation is the faint light of a candle that will shine bright at the end showing an unexpected truth."

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

"Whitechapel?"  
"Whitechapel is the section of the city we are in."  
Roosevelt looked around, truly seeing it for the first time, as the sun began burning away the fog. "I hope New York never has a slum like this!" he said devoutly.  
"Wait until New York has been around as long as London, and it will have this and worse," Hughes assured him.
