[![Working](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/w2-150x150.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/w2.jpg)As you can read in the sidebar, this website is in **early beta**.

We are working to be ready, as soon as possible, with all the covers, translations and, finally, our ebooks. But we are also testing the information architecture and we are searching for the best way to let you meet the ebook you're gonna love.
Maybe you can think this is an unconventional way to do our task, but publishing doesn't need to be boring.

We are testing some ideas. For example: why duplicate the authors bio when we can simply link their websitse,  Twitter or Wikipedia? There's no reason for _Just Another Bio_ when you can meet the author directly.
Some links could be broken for a little while, but it will not to be a fault:  that's because we are uploading  and connecting informations day by day. We are doing our best and soon we will be ready.

Many of you (that follow our adventure on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/40kBooks) or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/40k/122586614419616)) asked for info and we decided to open the door while we work.  So,  if you want, you can sit down and  have a coffee. Be patient with our pages, faults, and drafts. We will open later in july.
In these early days, don't trust excessively in what you read, because some information may change. And many news are coming soon.
