#1. _SheNoir_ has [an interview](http://www.shenoir.com/kristine-kathryn-rusch-_sn_264.html#) with Kristine Kathryn Rusch. In italian.
Kristine tells how she got the inspiration to write  "Except the music" (you can read the novelette in [english](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=2), [italian](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=14&product_id=27) and [portuguese](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=15&product_id=12))
