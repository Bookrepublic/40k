This really is a priceless collection of advice for anyone who wants to have a successful career as a writer.

I attended a writing seminar earlier this year for around $600 (not including travel, hotel, etc.), and without exaggeration, the information in this $3 ebook is worth at least as much as what I got out of that wonderful, and extremely helpful, three-day event.

Writers need to become more marketing savvy and augment their storytelling skills with storyselling skills, according to a branding expert at the University of Ulster.
Stephen Brown, Professor of Marketing Research in the Ulster Business School, and a specialist in the marketing strategies of brand-name authors like J.K. Rowling, James Patterson and Dan Brown, says that novelists need to wake up and smell the customer.
In his latest book, Selling Stories Successfully, Professor Brown states that the days of outsourcing selling have gone. Authors must build their own brands, sell their own books and take ownership of their self-marketing strategies.

**[Smart Self-Publishing: Becoming an Indie Author ](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Self-Publishing-Becoming-Author-ebook/dp/B004AYD90U/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&m=A3KSZ402CI2EG1&s=digital-text&qid=1297178341&sr=1-5)**

In this book, loud-and-proud indie author Zoe Winters, author of the paranormal romance "Preternaturals" series, pours out the experience she's amassed during years of research, writing, and working in the current self-publishing world. Winters brings this experience to aspiring indie authors with a plain talk, good sense, and humor. Hardly a dry textbook of publishing, Winters uses personal anecdotes and sometimes talks about things she learned the hard way and mistakes she made so you don't have to.

As an author involved in self-publishing, I have purchased and read several books on the subject. This book is the best I have found so far. It is up-to-date, well-organized, well written and provides a ton of useful information.

I would strongly recommend it, and I rarely give 5 star ratings. If you are looking for a place to start or to buy only one book, this is the one I would suggest.

Pricing in all businesses is a combination of art and science. Windwalker has been publishing Kindle eBooks since the beginning, included a top bestseller on the paid list, and has actively experimented with price points on dozens of titles. While the main point of this eBook is how to price after the new 70% royalty option was announced (hint - choose a price that meets the 70% royalty requirements), he also discusses the bigger picture of eBook pricing, including the trade-off between profit per sale and sales volume.
