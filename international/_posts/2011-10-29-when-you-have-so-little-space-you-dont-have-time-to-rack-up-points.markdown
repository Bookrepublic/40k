**Novels can have pauses, faults: a long story wins by points. A novelette, as Julio Cortazar wrote, needs to win by knock-out. Do you agree?**

I do agree. When you have so little space, you don't have time to rack up points. You have your brief time with the reader, and one chance to make an impression.

**Is there a literary bias against the short form of fiction?**

I don't think there's a literary bias. There are plenty of prestigious publications and awards geared to short fiction, and MFA programs still spend a lot of time on them. If anything, I would say there's a commercial bias against short fiction because of practical restrictions with the paper format. But hopefully that is changing as e-books become more popular.

**Plot, setting, ideas. What are in your opinion the perfect ingredients of a novelette/novella?**

Any combination I choose, there will be countless examples of excellent stories that use a different combination :-)

**Would you suggest 3 must-read novelettes/novellas?**

I am not very well read in short stories, but I recently read "In the Stacks" by Scott Lynch, which I really enjoyed. There is also the original "Ender's Game" short story by Orson Scott Card.
