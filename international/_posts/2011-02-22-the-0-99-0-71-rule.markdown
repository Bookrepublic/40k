[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/grisham_amazon_kindle.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=4984)"It’s interesting to see how low-priced books are gradually taking over the Kindle Store." Kindle Reviews asks [What happens if ebook prices drop to the $1 to $5 range?](http://ireaderreview.com/2011/02/19/what-happens-if-ebook-prices-drop-to-the-1-to-5-range/)
The post is interesting, a worth read.

Prices are a critical issue. This month we are running an experiment,  a special with all our ebooks ([essays](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=4044) & [stories](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=3849)) at a "indie" price: $ 0.99 | £ 0.71 on Amazon.
Obviously rough data convey little meaning. But, with lower prices, the preferences of our readers changed in some way.
We can share some information.
