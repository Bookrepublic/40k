**THE END OF PAPER BOOKS: YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO WIN AN ARGUMENT AGAINST CONVENIENCE**

There are moments when I wish I could follow the lead of Borges’ retired librarian and bury my book of sand on some obscure shelf in a library basement and just forget all about it. But then I realize that the thing is just too useful, too crazily convenient a tool to not embrace. And then I tell myself that it’s not possible, anyway, to shelve the advance of technology, and that history is filled with examples of beautiful things being supplanted by more efficient versions of those things.
Ultimately, you’re never going to win an argument against convenience, no matter how much you love the anachronistic, heavy, unwieldy, and beautiful thing you want to save.

**IS THIS THE END FOR BOOKS?**

_![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Avid-Reader-007.jpg)So what we can expect from books is what the internet has always given us. More. More of everything. But what of taking in continuous prose, in the form conventionally known as "reading"? One way or another, that's here to stay. Now, if Brewster Kahle could only find me a comfy chair and some room in one of his shipping containers, I could get back on the job.

**MAXIMIZING DIGITAL BOOK SALES**

This two part article is going to tackle exactly that question. The first part of the article will go in-depth regarding the importance of choosing the proper categories for your book and the advanced use of tags to maximize your book’s exposure. The second half the article will focus on what to expect from your book sales and how you can leverage the internal recommendation systems, especially of Amazon, to enhance your bottom line. Also know that the vast majority of advice given in these articles can be applied to other digital sales platforms such as Barnes & Noble, Kobo, etc.

**WHAT'S A BOOK WORTH?**

Imagine you're an author of a book that was published a few years ago, but you've retained ebook rights. Someone wants to be able to give away digital copies of the book for free to an unlimited number of readers. What sort of fee should you demand? After all, if everyone can get your book for free, they probably won't be buying the ebook anymore, and though some people might still want to buy a print copy, chances are there won't be a lot of them.

**WILL THE SPEED OF ONLINE READING DEPLETE OUR ANALYTIC THOUGHT?**

Will an immersion in digitally-dominated forms of reading change the capacity of the young readers to form and to develop their deep reading processes? No one at this moment possesses the evidence to answer these questions, but our children's development and our species' intellectual evolution require that we confront them.
