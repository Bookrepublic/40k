[![Black Swan - Bruce Sterling](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/blackswan_eng_t1.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=3) «I suppose we have to get used to people saying really idiotic things about science fiction»,  writes Shaun Duke. «Whether it's some blogger telling us that science fiction is dead (again) or a non-reader telling us that science fiction isn't literature, there seems to always be someone saying something wrong about the genre».

Shaun points out some example ([Why writing fantasy is better than writing science fiction](http://josephrobertlewis.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/writing-fantasy/)) and makes a good point.

[![Wikiworld - Paul Di Filippo - English version](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/wikiworld-difilippo_ok_t.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=11)Joseph Robert Lewis writes, with an argument based on a common misperception: «to write (good) science fiction you need to understand the future, which is impossible».
Lewis then continues with his second point: «really good science fiction totally kills  drama. Think about your modern life for a moment. Thanks to the phone in  your pocket, you’re never lost, never out of touch, never without  access to detailed information. And you can photograph or video anything  that happens so you have records or evidence. So you’re not going to  have a lot of drama related to being lost, confused, or miscommunicating  anything».

Duke responds:  «If only that were true. The problem? Science fiction isn't about the  future. It's only set there. Lewis assumes that setting determines  what the genre is about, but since that doesn't even work within his own  logic (since there are plenty of fantasy stories set in the present,  and, thus, for Lewis, must be about the present -- see urban fantasy) it  is remarkably faulty. Science fiction has never been about the future;  it has always been about the past and the present. Hence the oft  repeated claim (an accurate one, I might add) that science fiction is  allegorical; something about the future cannot be allegorical, since the  future, by definition, hasn't happened yet. Whether traditional  fantasy is about the past is debatable (most of it isn't), but science  fiction and the past/present are bosom buddies, and understanding that  is crucial to understanding the genre».
Definitely a worth reading post (even if you are not completely agree with it):  [Science Fiction:  It's Not About the Future (Part One)](http://wisb.blogspot.com/2010/11/science-fiction-its-not-about-future.html)
