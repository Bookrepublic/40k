**HOW TO HELP YOUR FAVORITE AUTHORS**

"Sometimes it’s just the author (or publishing house) with the biggest marketing budget who wins, but you, as a reader, have amazing power. Don’t believe for a second that you don’t have anything to do with whether an author makes it, because you do. A lot. No, really. A lot. Why does this matter to you? Well, authors who get to quit their day jobs can write faster and put more books out for you! The following are some little things you can do that can make a big difference."

**THE KINDLE SWINDLE - WHAT IS AND ISN'T GOOD ABOUT READING ON A DEVICE**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/gould_x220.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9246)"The iPad and its brothers will never completely succeed in replicating the experience of reading a book, and that's fine: that's what books are for, and will continue to be for. What we need is—I hesitate to write the word, but there seems to be no substitute for it in this context—"content" that is actually tailored to the medium from which it will be consumed. And for examples of how a medium can shape media, for better and for worse, we need only look to the Internet."

**THE USE OF CONVENTIONS IN FANTASY WRITING TO GAIN OUR ACCEPTANCE**

"Fantastical fiction, often a combination of heroic quest, fairy-tale settings and adventure, has in recent times become an increasingly popular part of our culture. Books such as the Harry Potter series and J.R.R. Tolkien's, The Lord of the Rings have all reached the heights of best-seller and have become a mainstay on the bookshelves. Perhaps the most essential factor behind this apparent popularity is the ability that the fantastical has of transporting the reader from their everyday world into an extraordinary world full of spiritual and moral meaning."

**THE STATE OF THE STIGMA**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Stigma-5-300x225.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9247)"The media — both traditional and social — is doing a fabulous job spreading the word that self-publishing has officially lost its stigma.  Outlets as venerable as The New York Times Sunday Book Review and PBS.org and have weighed in on the pros of going solo and how the changing landscape has brought this phenomenon into the mainstream. But two major caveats to the stigma’s end seem to have been left out of the conversation."

**THE 2011 HUGO AWARDS: THE NOVELETTE SHORTLIST**

"If the short story ballot feels like a snapshot of the genre short fiction scene in 2010, the same year's novelette ballot seems deliberately retro.  All but one of its stories are brimming with classic SF tropes--long-haul space voyages, Martian colonization, alien encounters, toolshed astronauts--and even more than that, with nostalgia for a time when those tropes dominated science fiction.  I wish I could say that that nostalgia is leavened by a sophisticated handling of characterization, and an understanding of some of the pernicious assumptions that underpin Golden Age SF, but unfortunately, with only one exception, that's not the case.  The result is a ballot that feels regressive and at time uncomfortably exclusionary."

**ON WRITING ACTION**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/indyaction-300x216.gif)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9252)"Action scenes enliven your story. They press your characters into action and force them to make quick decisions. They allow the writer to see personality on display, heroic or craven, strong or weak. At the same time, they are some of the trickiest bits to actually write. Do it well, and the reader is swept up into the excitement. Do it wrong, and your manuscript turns into a slog with page after page of going through the motions. So how do we write action that keeps us glued to the page?"

**THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING PRESENCE OF WOMEN SF WRITERS**

"Is science fiction sexist? A bald, potentially divisive and rather emotive question, there. But increasingly, science fiction and its close cousins, fantasy and horror, are being accused of an inherent downer on the female practitioners of the genre - and the latest offender appears to be the Guardian's recent online poll to find readers' favourite SF novels."
