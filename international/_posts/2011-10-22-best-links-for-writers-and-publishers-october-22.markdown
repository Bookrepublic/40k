**THE WORST BUSINESS IN THE WORLD**

"E-books are to publishers today what subscription houses were to publishers then: ingenious, earth-shattering ideas beloved by ordinary readers. Both make distribution more efficient by putting content into the hands of millions of Americans who don’t live near bookstores."
[Lapham's quarterly](http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/roundtable/the-worst-business-in-the-world.php) | [@bentarnoff](http://twitter.com/#!/bentarnoff)

**AMAZON SIGNS UP AUTHORS, WRITING PUBLISHERS OUT OF DEAL**

"“Everyone’s afraid of Amazon,” said Richard Curtis, a longtime agent who is also an e-book publisher. “If you’re a bookstore, Amazon has been in competition with you for some time. If you’re a publisher, one day you wake up and Amazon is competing with you too. And if you’re an agent, Amazon may be stealing your lunch because it is offering authors the opportunity to publish directly and cut you out.
“It’s an old strategy: divide and conquer,” Mr. Curtis said."
[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/technology/amazon-rewrites-the-rules-of-book-publishing.html?_r=4)

**REALLY, NEW YORK TIMES??**

"The point is: Amazon is so big it can afford to take losses on certain segments of its business as long as the overall business is healthy. They are brilliant strategists. They were very smartly willing to take a loss on some e-book sales to offer great prices and cement their place with consumers as the only e-book store worth visiting. Sadly for the publishing industry, no other retailer of books has such deep pockets and can afford to do what they do. Everyone else needs positive income from the books they sell to stay in business. And the same is true of publishers."

**PUBLISH THE WAY YOU WANT. IGNORE THE DINOSAURS.**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/photoxpress_10715248.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=12235) "Publishing today is all about creators of art getting their work out to those who appreciate it in many different ways, shapes and forms. To discount the writers who self publish is completely backwards thinking. Industry forward thinkers like Mark Coker, JA Konrath, Amazon and the writers who exploit these new avenues are the ones who will win, and those who remain in the exclusionary thinking of the publishing industry from 500 years ago will have their place, but not in this brave new world."

**WHAT IS PLATFORM**

"So what is this elusive platform? Let me first tell you want it's not. A platform is not your credentials. It has nothing to do with your degree or degrees, or the level of respect your colleagues have for you. A platform is your name recognition on a national or international level. It's how well you can sell books simply because you have a following."

**HOW MANY COPIES IS MY BOOK SELLING? NOW AUTHORS HAVE MORE ANSWERS**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/stacks-of-books-in-the-british-library-london-s.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=12236)"It is surprisingly hard for an author to know how many copies his or her book is selling. Now Simon & Schuster (NYSE: CBS) is giving its authors real-time access to their sales information for the first time, and Random House and Hachette Book Group just announced they will do the same.
The New York Times (NYSE: NYT) describes these publishers’ efforts as a move to “challenge Amazon (NSDQ: AMZN) and its continued efforts to woo authors,” but I think the end result is that Amazon will be forced to start providing authors with more e-book sales data."

**HOW AMAZON MAKES MONEY FROM THE KINDLE**

"Amazon's Kindle is no longer just a product: It's a whole ecosystem. Specifically, it's not just an e-book reader but a tablet, a media store, a platform for digital media sales, and even a publishing imprint. The Kindle ecosystem is also Amazon's fastest-growing product and could account for more than 10% of the company's revenue next year. So Amazon observers are understandably curious: How does Amazon generate revenue from the Kindle ecosystem? Does it generate any profit yet? Will it ever generate profit? How much?"

**AMAZON: FRIEND, FOE, OR SCARECROW?**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/4533571331_a86cca10b8.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=12239)"One could argue (and so I will), that by moving into “traditional” publishing, Amazon is simply acknowledging that content is and always will be King, and while the self-publishing angle has worked out quite well for them, only a few handfuls of authors are truly making any notable profit on $2.99 ebooks. Some of those authors have subsequently been scooped up by “traditional” publishers who are effectively doing the same thing Amazon is doing, and have been for years."
