"Science fiction appears to have two big problems in the marketplace. One is that fantasy is outselling it by about 3:1.

The other is that at least half (possibly more, depending on your classification criteria) of what is being sold as sci-fi is actually fantasy with some sci-fi elements – meaning the sci-fi market is actually much smaller than the stats suggest.

Of course, I’m only talking about books here. In the world of films and video games, science fiction is doing very well indeed."
