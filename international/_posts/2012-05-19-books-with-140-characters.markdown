"This is a shame, because from my seat — as an author, a journalist and, yes, a tweeter — Twitter is anything but a threat to the world of publishing and reading. It’s an opportunity.

The format of books isn’t the only thing that’s changing — the entire reading experience is undergoing a shift. E-book publishers, at least, understand that their platforms allow readers to comment on the text and, significantly, enable them to see feedback left by other readers.

Maybe the book isn’t dying, after all. It’s just getting a social life."
