> Picture the scene. You’re a struggling writer. You’ve written the most incredible story.
You’ve come up with a yarn that’s Twilight times ten, a novel that makes Larsson’s Millennium Trilogy look so last century.

There’s only one problem.
It’s a major problem, however.
You’ve got to sell the thing.
You have to persuade people to buy it, both literally and metaphorically.
You’ve woken up to the fact that storytelling and storyselling are two completely different things.

As J.G. Ballard once ruefully observed: “any fool can write a novel but it takes real genius to sell it”.


[![Selling Stories Successfully](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/selling-brown_ok_t.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=6&product_id=46)His name is Brown and he wrote a Code, but he is not Dan.

Stephen [jokes about that](http://www.sfxbrown.com/biographies). For this and many other reasons Stephen Brown could actually be listed as one of the writers that he loves to talk about, because of their creativity in storyselling as well as in storytelling.

Stephen is a unconventional professor at the University of Ulster. He wrote several smart books with smart titles such as _The Marketing Code_, _Wizard! Harry Potter’s Brand Magic_, _Fail Better_.

Thanks to him, 40k's readers will be amazed by a crazy gallery of anecdotes dealt with famous authors' works and lives.

[This essay](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=6&product_id=46) shows that the mash-up between literature and marketing can really works in order to turn a story into a bestseller. And it works much more in the digital contest...


> So, what do you do? How do you ensure that your Twilight times ten  gets  selected ahead of every other Twilight times ten on the  publisher’s  slush pile? Fortunately, there is a simple solution:  Instead of turning into the  Business & Management aisles of your  friendly neighbourhood  mega-bookstore, or online emporium, head  straight for the fiction  section.

Yes, the fiction section. The best insights into buying and  selling  and marketing and branding, and all that other awful stuff, are  found  in works of fiction, not big boring anthologies or dry-as-dust  academic  articles. When it comes to sales & marketing, one learned   commentator makes clear, “you can learn more from a reasonably good   novel than a solid piece of social science research”.
