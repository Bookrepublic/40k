_Rhys Hughes is a prolific short story writer with an eclectic mix of influences, from Calvino to Borges. Much of his work is of a humorously eccentric bent, often parodies and pastiches with surreal and absurdist overtones._

**Novels can have pauses, faults: a long story wins by points. A novelette, as Julio Cortazar wrote, needs to win by knock-out. Do you agree?**

Yes, that's an accurate definition of the raison d'Ãªtre of a good novella. A particularly revealing example of the truth of this is [Behold the Man](http://www.amazon.com/Behold-Man-Michael-Moorcock/dp/1585677647) by Michael Moorcock. The original novella was the first work of fiction I ever read by that author and it impressed me enormously. It is concise, rich, overwhelming, a superb example of the literature of the imagination, a genuinely dangerous piece of writing. When Moorcock turned it into a full-length novel it became merely an unwise expansion and a lot of the force was lost.

**Is there a literary bias against the short form of fiction?**

Yes, to a certain extent. Fashions come and go and at this moment in time the short-story isn't as generally popular a literary form as it was back in the 1950s. But I see no reason why it shouldn't become fashionable again.

The most renowned Chinese writer of modern times, Lu Xun, wrote only short stories; so did Jorge Luis Borges, of course; Donald Barthelme, wrote mainly short works and his influence is immense; Muriel Spark's best work is in the short story form; Isaac Bashevis Singer put all his greatest energies and invention into his short stories; personally I regard J.G. Ballard's best work to be a collection of linked stories, [Vermilion Sands](http://www.amazon.com/Vermilion-Sands-ebook/dp/B004GKMUVM/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&m=A3KSZ402CI2EG1&qid=1319467360&sr=8-1).

**Plot, setting, ideas. What are in your opinion the perfect ingredients of a novelette/novella?**

Unique concepts, cleverly engineered plots, enthralling language. A novella is an opportunity for an author to prove how sharp and careful they can be. A truly great novella is never just a compressed novel or an expanded short story but a fully integrated work that inhabits its own length precisely.

**Would you suggest 3 must-read novelettes/novellas?**

[The Last Castle](http://www.amazon.com/Last-Castle-Jack-Vance/dp/0425084787/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1319467421&sr=1-1-catcorr) by Jack Vance. This work contains in condensed form all the elements that make Vance such a fine writer, the vibrancy, humour, action, quaintness and muscular baroque language.

[The Dead Lady of Clown Town](http://www.amazon.com/Rediscovery-Man-Complete-Science-Cordwainer/dp/0915368560/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1319467476&sr=1-1-catcorr) by Cordwainer Smith. An exemplary novella, a legend from the future, very clear and strange and exquisitely moving.

[Five Letters from an Eastern Empire](http://www.amazon.com/Five-Letters-Eastern-Empire-Penguin/dp/0146000447/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1319467514&sr=1-1-catcorr) by Alasdair Gray. A perfect story, the best novella I have ever read, a devastating satire on power and manipulation.
