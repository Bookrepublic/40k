**A CRITICAL MARKETING SECRET: DON'T GO IT ALONE**

"I wonder how many book signings might turn out to be worthwhile (and succeed despite the advice Ferriss received) if authors devoted time and energy to bringing their own communities to—or creating communities around—those in-person events. I wonder how many signings turn out to be worthwhile long after the fact, due to sparking or sustaining valuable relationships and stronger networks."

**ARE MANY WORLDS AND THE MULTIVERSE THE SAME IDEA?**

"When physicists are asked about “parallel worlds” or ideas along those lines, they have to be careful to distinguish among different interpretations of that idea. There is the “multiverse” of inflationary cosmology, the “many worlds” or “branches of the wave function” of quantum mechanics, and “parallel branes” of string theory. Increasingly, however, people are wondering whether the first two concepts might actually represent the same underlying idea. (I think the branes are still a truly distinct notion.)"

**GETTING YOUR BACKLIST UP: A REPORT FROM THE 2011 NEBULAS**

"A brief definition: an author’s backlist includes all the books she’s written that are no longer in print.  They may be floating around used book stores or on Amazon, but they’re not actively published.  Some writers have many works of this type, and what to do with them has always been a problem. Enter the world of e-books!  A beloved author like our own Sherwood Smith can convert all her backlist YA novels into ebooks, bringing them before a new generation of readers with relative ease."

**AMAZON WANTS A PAPERBACK PARTNER, AS EISLER REVEALS HIS DEAL**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_584643.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9227)"In other words, it seems to be travelling back to the future, seeing itself in the role of the traditional hardcover house looking to find a paperback reprinter, only the hardcovers have morphed into e-books and the paperbacks have morphed into hardcovers. What was crystal clear was the reaction of one publisher whom Patrick had approached: “Think of how hard it would be for our sales force to sell that to B&N;!”"

**WILL E-BOOKS BECOME THE NEXT NAPSTER?**

"As the Guardian notes, publishers must be quaking in their boots — that’s a ton of lost revenue, plus a quarter of users who admitted to e-book piracy said they would keep on downloading illegally. Record labels notoriously lost millions thanks to Napster (which was eventually ruled illegal), and now publishers are staring down the same tunnel."

**AN OPEN LETTER TO PUBLISHERS ABOUT THE SALE YOU LOST TODAY**

"Anyway, I want to explain to you about the $9.99 that you lost today. It involves a purchase I made in good faith this morning from that stalwart (and lone) Canadian ebook seller, Kobo Books. They will shortly be refunding me this money—learning from the past experience of at least four previous complaints of a similar nature, I submitted fairly substantial documentation along with my customer service query—but for now, let’s still call it a purchase so that you can understand what’s happened here."

**THE EARTH IS FLAT, AND CREATIVITY CAN'T BE TRAINED**

"Einstein, Edison and da Vinci were, simply put, lucky. They had the perfect combination of genetics and environment, not often duplicated, and certainly not intentionally so. That’s because creativity and innovation can’t be trained."

**WHAT DOES IT COST TO READ A BOOK? HOW EBOOKS WILL CHANGE BOOK BUYING HABITS**

"With hardback and paperback sales sliding down the charts while ebook sales rising, it appears the new paperback book is the ebook.  Unlike the past, where readers had to wait months or years for the paperback edition to come out, the ebook and hardback are now published simultaneously.  This is great news for readers until you realize what has happened is the price of a paperback has been increased.  You get to read it sooner, but it costs more – but the whole point of mass market paperbacks was to read books for less."

**HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE EBOOK PIRACY**

"I get asked this question a lot. It tells me something that I used to get asked (breathlessly) “OMG, what are you going to do about piracy!?!?!” and nowadays the conversation is a little less fraught with hysteria. This is a good thing, for several reasons. One is that hysteria rarely solves problems. Two is that it may mean that people are taking a more rational approach to the realities of the digital world."
