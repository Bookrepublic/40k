"A beautifully crafted modern fairy tale where absurdity joins with revelation, and a transcendent experience leaves behind chaos, a hint of cinnamon, frog spit, and subtle musics."
[GoldenGryphon.com]

The story of a resigned librarian who can see shades of silence and talks to portraits. A fairy tale romance with a strong sense of fantastic.

A story with a big frog.

_"A big one _– _five feet long and four wide. Stands three feet at the shoulder. Found him myself in the South American rainforest. Very rare. And smart, devious – even Machiavellian – in his intrigues"_

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

"My lady, everyone loves me. It's part of my Glamour, useful when I must travel in this world."

**FIRST REACTIONS**

"Jeff Vandermeer has a very natural talent to create fantastic worlds out of simple and common things, so everyday life is able to become more than magical. In Greensleves, he carefully uses motifs like the frog, the eagle and a peculiar look in the eyes of the characters as gates that lead into a magic universe where colors, sounds, and even the silence have a spirit of their own."
