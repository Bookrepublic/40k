I have come to understand that she is what they are.  A woman accepts a man, expecting that he will change. A man takes a woman,  expecting that she will never change. They are both disappointed. Yet within  this very disappointment is the primal source of all new men and all new  women_».

An unpublished novelette by [Bruce Sterling](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=1769).

«_No one within the castle had  ever been able to overcome the severe grammatical problems associated with Ida.  Sometimes she was “she,” sometimes they were “they”. There were further problems  with the singular form, the plural form, the feminine plural possessives, the  feminine singular and plural pronoun declensions, and so forth.
Even when I  came to know Ida, Clemenza, Vittoria, particularly well, so much so that I used  affectionate diminutives for her, and the intimate familiar form rather than any  formal honorifics, I used to stumble over the simplest Italian sentences: “You”  (singular) come embrace me,” or “You (plural) please give me a kiss_”».
