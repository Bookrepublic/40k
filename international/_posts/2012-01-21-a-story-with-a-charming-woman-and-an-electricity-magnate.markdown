When the head of the local cop shop phones to call in a favour, our PI is unable to refuse.

Electricity magnate, Theo Carr wants to know what his son is up to. All the Gumshoe has to go on is a scrap of paper and two words. Soliciting the help of his old friend Jimmy the Griff leads the PI to young Donny Carr and a syren club. A syren song can turn your brain to mush. Donny is syren-smitten.

But just why is Captain Silverback so interested? What links Carr’s electricity empire to the syren clubs? Fortunately, Gumshoe has wax earplugs and an operatic skeleton key to help him solve the case.

**THE STRING CITY MYSTERIES**

"A hard-boiled private investigator with a talent for twisting dimensions … a beautiful dame … a changeling baby made of wood … the perfect ingredients for the first of my String City Mysteries, a series of fantasy noir detective romps due to be published by 40k Books throughout 2012.

I wrote _The Wooden Baby_ immediately after devouring a Dashiell Hammett anthology. I’m not the first to mix up the fantasy and detective genres, but it’s such a juicy collision I can’t resist it. Later stories in the series explore the strange city where my nameless gumshoe lives, but this first adventure just places him in an anonymous office in the middle of, apparently, nowhere.

_The Wooden Baby_ by Graham Edwards was first published in the April 2005 edition of [Realms of Fantasy](http://www.rofmag.com/)."

**A SINGLE QUOTE**

"«Satellite view», I said.  
«Oh, if you insist», the map replied. «Although you do realise that my first priority, given that you have already selected a destination, is to compute your optimum route and estimated journey time …»  
«Just do it» I said, «or I’m trading you in for a road atlas.»"
