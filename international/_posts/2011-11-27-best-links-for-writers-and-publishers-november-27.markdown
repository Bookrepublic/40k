**THE CRITICAL ASPECTS OF DIGITAL PUBLISHING**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/barry-eisler-09.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=12827)"Third, and flowing from the first two: in a digital world, the primary value a publisher can offer an author is direct-to-consumer marketing. This is why Amazon is so strongly positioned to succeed in digital publishing: its book business is built on its ability to reach tens or even hundreds of millions of readers directly by email. Amazon marketing is both exceptionally focused (book buyers) and exceptionally broad (tens or even hundreds of millions of customers). Entities that can offer authors compelling direct-to-consumer marketing value will be in a good position to take a cut of the profits."

**THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF BOOK MARKETING**

"Let’s go back to what the author wants. It is easy to think that every writer wants to connect with readers and be more social. After all, those are the times we are living, right? I suspect otherwise and I believe Seth does too (if you listen to the interview he shares how a lot of people apply to be “picked” by him even if he strictly says that he doesn’t want applications). Many people don’t want to take the initiative and would much rather do what they do best which is writing and then let the publisher do the rest. Yet, it is inevitable that in a noisy world, authors who want to sell will have to work at keeping their community of readers (buyers) ready for their next release somehow."

**ONLINE WORLDS: VIRTUOUS ENVIRONMENTS FOR PUBLISHERS**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_26739754.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=12828)"Children are flocking to virtual worlds and online games. Club Penguin, Stardoll, Moshi Monsters and Farmville have become well-established brands in the online world. It makes sense that some of the biggest brands in children’s publishing are now getting in on the act. This year saw the launch of Pottermore, and Scholastic’s Horrible Histories World. And the concept of ‘transmedia’ – taking a story across several different media – was much discussed at The Bookseller’s annual Children’s Conference in October.  
A virtual environment can, of course, bring a child’s favourite book to life – but importantly, it can also create additional revenue for the publisher."

**WHY PUBLISHERS SHOULD BUILD DIRECT SALES CHANNELS [VIDEO]**

"Building a direct sales channel is still one of the most significant opportunities many publishers still have in front of them. Some have resisted up to now, fearful of rocking the boat with their retailer partners. O'Reilly has done a terrific job building a direct channel. In this TOC video podcast, we hear from the head of O'Reilly's online and marketing groups, Allen Noren (@allennoren). He shares his opinions on deep discount campaigns, membership programs and how to compete globally, especially in fixed-pricing countries like Germany."

**PUBLISHERS GET INTO THE E-SINGLES SCENE**

"In publishing, small is the new big. An increasing number of publishers are releasing e-singles -- short works published digitally on a variety of platforms -- to generate ancillary revenue, build brand equity, and reach new audiences. Among those joining the e-singles market are Hearst, Rodale, Princeton University Press, and as recently as last week, Penguin.  
E-Singles have potentially disruptive potential in digital publishing. Of course disruption has both positive and negative repercussions. For example, there has already been talk that e-singles could provide a way for writers to disintermediate publishers by taking their e-singles directly to market via tools like Amazon Singles. However it is clear that when a publisher such as Hearst -- known for its many consumer magazine titles that include ELLE, Esquire, and O -- joins the e-singles market, that mini ebooks are ripe for experimentation."
