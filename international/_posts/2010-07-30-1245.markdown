![Appel, Crouzet, Rusch](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/prima.jpg)

Our first ebooks are finally here. You can buy them from [Smashwords](http://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/40kbooks) and tomorrow morning (italian time) you'll find them in Bookrepublic too.  In the next days they will be shipped to Amazon, Barnes&Noble and other stores.

We decided to publish a [bunch of titles](http://www.40kbooks.com/) before holidays, then -starting in the third week of august- all the [promised ebooks](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=311) will  progressively follow.  And in September we will announce more stories and more essays.

So, you can start reading **Fallout** by [Jacob Appel](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=57): it's a wonderful novelette about the September 11 psychosis, a short masterpiece imbued with irony and tenderness.
The story is available in [english](../?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=6), [italian](../?page_id=133&category=14&product_id=26), and [portuguese(brasil)](../?page_id=133&category=15&product_id=17).

Or you can love the suspance of **Except the music**, a sofisticate novelette by [Kristine Kathryn Rusch](http://www.40kbooks.com/?p=20).  The  story,  an absolutely realist plot with a bit of magic, is available in [english](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=13&product_id=2), [italian](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=133&category=14&product_id=27), and [portuguese(brasil)](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/exceptthmusic_por_t.png).

If you want to to feed your mind, you can choice** La stratégie du cyborg**: a provocative essay about the concept of the author in a connected world, available in french and in italian.
This book will not be available in Smashwords for technical reasons: _La stratégie_ is a structured hypertext (an essay wrote to be digital) and need a well formatted .epub to grant a good experience of reading.  You'll find it tomorrow morning in Bookrepublic and in the future in other stores.

In the last weeks we started a conversation with [our followers on Twitter](http://twitter.com/40kBooks) and [our fans on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/40kbooks). Now we can start to discuss with you about our books. So, if you like to be part of a community, feel free to twit us what you think (hashtag #40kbooks) or simply review our books on the platform you used to download it. Here you have [our policy](http://www.40kbooks.com/?page_id=950) about reviews: we hope you join our conversation.
