**HOW SELF-PUBLISHING CAME OF AGE**

"It's the internet, and the inexorable rise of ebooks, say authors, that have been the game changers. Even JK Rowling has finally bowed to the inevitable, announcing this week that she and her publisher, Bloomsbury, would be launching ebooks on her new website, Pottermore (and not, incidentally, sharing ebook revenues with booksellers). Taylor, meanwhile, is selling more ebooks than paperbacks by six to one. "What's the point in going to a publisher for them to cream off the profit? You can put an ebook up in a week"."

**5 THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN TALENT**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/4305324425_be19fc7119.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=9785) "Now that I’m a professor, I realize just how irrelevant that question is. I see both talented and untalented students, but the ones who impress me are the ones who are motivated and driven to work—the ones who push hard despite obstacles. I also clearly see who has a positive attitude, and who is apathetic. So far, these other qualities have mattered more than talent. Outside of the classroom, when I’m in my Writer’s Digest role, many writers ask me: “Should I keep going? Do I have any talent at this?” Boy how have I come to hate that question! Let me tell you the five questions I find more relevant and meaningful."

**IF I WERE AN UNPUBLISHED AUTHOR, WOULD I SELF-PUBLISH?**

"The more I think about it, the more I feel for a new writer with no backlist, the most important thing to do is write three manuscripts first, before investing heavily in promotion.  The investment is time.  That is our most valuable resource.  It needs to be spent on learning the craft of writing. I posted recently about Indie vs Trads. There is this argument on the Trads side that indies haven’t paid their dues. But what are the dues? There is no author training like having to go to medical school to be a doctor or the training I went through to become a Green Beret. Author training is two-fold. First, the writing. Second, the publishing."

**LITERARY AGENTS TRY NEW ROLE AS SELF-PUBLISHING CONSULTANTS**

"With big publishing buying only the crème de la crème of books, and more authors turning to self-publishing, many literary agents are getting squeezed right out of the middle. But some savvy agents are acting as literary consultants to help their authors self-publish, a role that offers up new opportunities and challenges for everybody in the industry. I talked with three agents about their experiments to serve authors by widening their middle ground."

**12 REASONS WHY SELF-PUBLISHING KICKS BUTT OVER TRADITIONAL PUBLISHING**

"Speaking as someone who has been traditionally published and self-published, I understand both sides of the equation. I was elated when I got my first book deal, but after subsequent book deals, that excitement faded. I still get aggravated whenever a royalty check arrives because those checks are pitifully low compared to what I earn from my self-published titles. The publishing house is the one reaping all of the rewards. If you’re thinking about your publishing options, following are some reasons why self-publishing rules over traditional publishing—and why now is the best time to take control over your work."

**IF BIG AUTHORS DO NOT NEED BIG PUBLISHERS, THEN WHAT ARE BIG PUBLISHERS FOR?**

"If big authors do not need big publishers then what are big publishers for? An author’s ties of loyalty to publishers are, rightly, often enormous: most feel their success is shared with the team who have helped build it. Publishing is a deeply collaborative process and most publishers are passionate about what they do: there are many reasons for authors to want to be loyal to publishers. However, the disparity between what the worlds biggest authors are capable of earning by publishing their own e-books and what their publishers are offering them has grown so enormous that that loyalty is being severely tested. We are talking about millions of pounds."

**EVOLVE OR DIE **

"When I was breaking in to the field, self-publishing was paying big bucks to scam outfits to “publish” your book because you weren’t good enough to publish the conventional way. A self-published author was more to be pitied than censured. A lot has changed since then. Thanks to ebooks, self-publishing is now cheap and easy. Some of the stigma has worn off, but not all. The upside of that is that beginning hopefuls aren’t being scammed out of thousands of dollars with nothing to show for it but a basement full of books that aren’t good for anything but furnace-food. The lives of millions of trees are spared. The downside is that a lot if not all beginners now think that self-publishing is the norm, and still self-publish with the same motivation and lack of awareness that vanity publishers once based their entire business model around."
