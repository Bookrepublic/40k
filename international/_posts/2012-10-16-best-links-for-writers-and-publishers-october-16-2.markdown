**TEN WAYS TO SAVE THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY**

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Amazon-CEO-Bezos-holds-up-010.jpeg) "Publish for readers, not authors. The 21st-century publishing environment has tipped the balance still further towards the importance of the reader. The garrote that Amazon has applied, using its market share to obtain ever higher discounts from publishers that, in turn, allow price cuts that secure still more customers, is possible because of the behemoth's direct relationship to readers. To break this stranglehold, publishers must start selling direct. The longer-term advantages of using their own customer databases to sell at full price, rerouting the additional revenue into marketing, will outweigh any initial discomfort about eschewing the services of the world's largest booksellers."

**AMAZON AUTHOR RANKINGS AND WHO THEY ACTUALLY BENEFIT**

"Amazon has started ranking authors by total sales via Amazon, updated hourly. This is certain to make a whole bunch of authors begin to freak out as they constantly refresh their Amazon author pages to see where they stand in the rankings, and, independently, give a whole bunch of people who have their own hobby horses about the state of the industry a bunch of ammunition to make proclamations about how the industry is changing in exactly the way they want it to change, so there, ha ha!
So, on this subject, some thoughts for people to consider when they look at these rankings."

**AROUND THE WORLD, NO SET RULES FOR EBOOK PRICING OR DIGITAL READING**

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_107625431.jpeg) "Ebook pricing and device trends that hold in North American countries don’t necessarily work for less developed market. Executives from Barnes & Noble, Kobo, Google, France’s FNAC and India’s Indiaplaza discussed similarities and differences between digital reading cultures."

**READ THE WAY YOU WRITE**

"Of course, it is good to want to work on your writing, and it’s perfectly normal to want to spend every waking moment getting better at it. And sure, reading can feel a bit frivolous when compared to that necessary hard work. But reading is not procrastinating, even if it is fun (and I sure hope you think it is!): it is an important part of maintaining and honing your skills, staying inspired, and keeping in touch with why you write. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that being an appreciative and reflective reader is one of the best ways to work on your writing. After all, where did you learn most of your skills: from a classroom, on the internet, or from thoughtfully reading great books?

To take the best advantage of your reading for your writing, I recommend keeping a reading journal."

**BOOK BUYERS WOULD PREFER FREE BOOKS WITH ADVERTISING TO PAYING, SURVEY SAYS**

"We are exposed to publicity all the time, on the radio, the television, at the movies and so on, so advertising in an ebook follows the same model. The best of all, it makes ebooks cheaper, or, even better than that, it allows them to be offered for free."
