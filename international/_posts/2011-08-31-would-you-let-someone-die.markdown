> **LOVE OR DEATH?**

![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/sickness_sito1.jpg)No other woman is generous as much as Tracey Rose is. She volunteered in the children's room of the public library and at the nature preserve; every evening she puts on the table a moulticourse vegan supper. Gadney knows how lucky he is. Her boy, JJ, genuinely like him, never direct resentment at his mother's lover. And yet, Gadney  wonders if Tracey could really understand him, his beliefs, his deep convintions. Gadney is a medical doctor and Tracey a Christian Scientists: they reject science and believe that disease comes from sin and that only the Lord can heal us.

The day that measles started to spread between Cormorant Cove's children their convinctions crash. JJ needs a doctor, Tracey Rose doesn't want to go there. And then a child died.

_"How can you possibly explain three young children getting sick at the same time", asked Gadney, choosing each word carefully, "By any means other than contagion?"_

_"If they play toghether", Norma snapped, "they probably sin together."_
