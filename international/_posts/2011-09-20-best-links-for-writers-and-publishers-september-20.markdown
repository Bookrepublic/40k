**READERS ARE THE PARTNERS - NOT THE CUSTOMERS - OF DIGITAL PUBLISHERS**

_Rachel Aydt's interview for Publishing Perspectives to Giuseppe Granieri, 40k's Editorial Director_

"We live in accelerated times. If you have a great idea and that idea works well, a few weeks are enough time to see everyone doing it, or simply to discover that your niche is filled. That’s why you must build the brand awareness with your individual style, with your approach, with your never-ending stream of ideas. What sets us apart is that we also realize that our readers are the partners — not the customers — of digital publishers. We listen very carefully to our readers and take seriously our commitment to them."

**THE MYTH OF THE 99 CENT BOOK. THE VALUE DROPS. NOBODY WINS.**

"Three has been quite lot of buzz around the rumor that Amazon is going to create a renting model around ebooks. I have two problems with that. First of all, I believe the digital renting business is fundamentally flawed. It makes sense in a world in which renting can reduce the cost of inventory. But in a digital world there is no inventory. Renting is a business model for physical products. My biggest concern, however, is one of price."

**DISRUPTION IS NOT A DIRTY WORD**

"The large publishers will tell you that people are quite happy to pay $9.99 or even $14.99 for John Grisham’s latest. But these readers are not attached to the price point or the publisher, the brand they are loyal to is the author.
If John Grisham suddenly decided to self-publish, his readers wouldn’t abandon him because he was shorn of his publisher’s logo, or priced at $4.99. In fact, I would bet anything that his sales would rise."

**IS IT TIME TO RETHINK E-BOOKS?**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/0204-02_jefferson_project_gutenberg_books.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=11663)"Hyperbole aside, e-book dissidents dismiss largely based on nostalgia and sentimentality of the time that once-was, much like what happened when the television moved into the living room, crowding out the Wholesome Radio.
But the arrival of the e-book is not like that of the television; televisions offered an entirely new dimension to radio. The vast majority of e-books offer little more added value than an ability to carry more books at once than ever before."

**PUBLISHING VS SELF-PUBLISHING: AMAZON IS THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS**

"But when Amazon heard about my decision, they approached me and essentially offered me the best of both worlds: the kind of split, control, and time-to-market I wanted from self-publishing, combined with Amazon's marketing muscle."

**THE TWO WORLDS OF LITERATURE: WHAT SERIOUS WRITERS CAN LEARN FROM GENRE COMRADES IN ARMS**

"The belletristic establishment regards the world of popular literature as a subculture, but one could seriously argue that it is really the other way around. Very few “serious” writers make enough money from their writing to support themselves without having to moonlight. Their audiences are often modest in size and elitist in taste. Their work is frequently inaccessible, intellectual, experimental, and sometimes incomprehensible. Literary authors are often isolated from their fellow writers both physically and artistically, so that they have little sense of community or opportunities for intellectual cross-pollination."

**HOW TO BUILD YOUR CREDIBILITY USING TWITTER**

"Your Twitter updates should reflect you and your interests. If you are trying to establish yourself as a digital publishing expert you’ll need to tweet about news and issues. More importantly you need to let your followers know your opinions, knowledge and expertise. You should also aim to curate your Twitter feed to reflect wider interests (professional and/or personal). Give your followers reasons to listen to you."
