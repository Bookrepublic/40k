**HOW AMAZON'S TABLET PERPETUATES APPLE'S STRANGLEHOLD ON MEDIA APP DISTRIBUTION**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/amazon-tablet-7.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=11732)"That's unfortunate—if Apple's terms become the default industrywide, it will be another blow against the ability of already-ailing content companies to survive the transition away from print. By failing to offer publishers a real alternative, it seems just as likely that Amazon's terms will drive publishers to the much-better-trafficked Apple App store, where at least they can try to make up on volume what they aren't making per unit."

**HOW THE AMAZON TABLET WILL 1-CLICK ENABLE YOUR LIFE**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/314956-amazon-tablet-rumor.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=11733)"Let me be clear, if Amazon comes out with a glorified cash register next week, I will be very disappointed. Any tablet it releases needs to offer the kind of performance and functionality that we have come to expect from a tablet. That means it will need to work with a variety of software products, and ideally support multiple shopping experiences. If it wants content partners, it should also consider a more balanced revenue sharing structure. (Apple gets 30 percent of every purchase made through any AppStore app.)  Hell, it has to support Flash. 
The potential is there. Amazon has access to revenue streams no other tablet manufacturer has. Apple used iTunes and the AppStore to drive the success of the iPad; Amazon can do something similar with Amazon.com and its multitude of digital services."

**KINDLE TABLET IS COMING, WHAT IT MEANS TO CONSUMERS**

"Make no mistake, Amazon doesn’t want to sell you a tablet, it wants to sell you more stuff. The Kindle Tablet will make this easy to do, and easy to enjoy the digital goods purchased on the tablet. Competing with Apple and Android tablets will be a natural side effect of the Kindle Tablet, but it’s not Amazon’s objective."

**WHAT DOES AMAZON'S KINDLE FIRE TABLET MEAN FOR THE MARKETPLACE/E-COMM SIDE OF THE BIZ?**

"I believe there are two impacts for sellers and Amazon's e-commerce business from Fire:

1. A surge in new Prime users (this assumes the device comes with Prime)  - Details below.

2. Pin-action from traffic - As we've seen from the last couple of year's Kindle launches, the device simply brings a lot of people into the front door of Amazon and there's a fair amount of pin action. "Oh, while I'm here, I'll go ahead and order that blu-ray player and soccer gear I was looking for.".  I think you'll see a good 2-5m incremental new users coming to the site."

**AMAZON KINDLE FIRE VS APPLE IPAD; A DAVID AND GOLIATH STORY?**

"The irony is that the Kindle Fire, or whatever it will be called, is widely believed to be a relatively low-tech, mid-performance tablet, with limited connectivity options (read: no 3G) and many of the exact same components from failed tablet offerings…but it just may be the iPad killer!  Well, that is version of the story that builds anticipation.  Therein lays the heart of the irony.  Americans (and yes the rest of the world) love Apple and everything that it has done to make us self-reliant, quasi-social drones...and feel quite happy about it."

**AMAZON'S KINDLE TABLET WILL BE THE FIRST TRUE MEDIA TABLET**

"Amazon cares little about the post-PC world, unlike Apple and Microsoft (NSDQ: MSFT) who are playing that different game. Instead, Amazon is driven by a post disc and post print world where all media will be digital.
Amazon will build a true media tablet. The first true media tablet. The Kindle tablet will focus on the future of all media — TV, movies, music, books, magazines — to enable Amazon to become the dominant digital media retailer. That is Amazon’s ambition."

**AMAZON ON FIRE**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/amazon-box-s.png)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=11736)"Back to predictions, and that reevaluation. I now say (deep breath) for the next couple of years, only two significant tablet players will matter for publishing product: iOS on Apple and Android on Amazon, both due to their retail operations (Nook development will prove a bad investment). Apple will remain the music, design, browsing and bit-crunching (read: gaming) powerhouse, but with publishing product and a retail operation covering real-world goods, as well as an unbeatable cloud operation, Amazon possesses its own advantages."
