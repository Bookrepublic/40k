**PUBLISHERS ADDING VALUE ON THE MARKETING SIDE**

"If I were an author (or agent) looking for a sci-fi publisher, it would impress me that Macmillan has lists that get a 30% open rate. It would make me feel they could do things to promote my book that another publisher without those lists couldn’t do. I don’t know what the growth rate is on those lists, but most things (sales, device penetration, self-publishing) in the digital publishing world have been more than doubling each year and these could well be too.  
The key point to take on board here is that tor.com is a flagship; Macmillan is doing this across their company. They are building other verticals as well. If other publishers aren’t systematically taking names, getting email permissions, and testing what can be done with them, Macmillan will build up marketing capabilities that it will get increasingly expensive to compete against."

**THE MANY FUTURES OF BOOKS**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/Ebook-reader-in-Waterston-007.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=12775)"My prediction about books in the early years of the 21st century: readers, writers, and bibliophiles in general will look back on the cross-fertilisation of the digital world with the global recession, and marvel at the strange fruit that flourished in the paradise of texts.  
[...] Ebook or Unbound? You pays your money and you makes your choice. The future's bright; the future's in the text. Black on white, in many formats."

**AMERICAN READERS' TRANSLATION PRIVATION**

"Complaints about the rarity with which American publishers pay attention to foreign books date back generations. There's a magic number every foreign publisher knows, whatever the year-to-year fluctuations: Only about 3 percent of the fiction for sale in the English-speaking world has been translated from another language. By contrast, in continental Europe, as much as 25 to 30 percent of a mainstream house's titles may be translations, with the bulk of them from the United States. In one year, 30 percent of all books published in Italy were translations, with 50 percent of those from English. It is, for non-U.S. publishers around the world, the never-ending story."

**HOW'S AMAZON PUBLISHING DOING?**

"These concerns are far from groundless, but what we have lacked so far is an objective evaluation of Amazon’s performance to date as a publisher. Given Amazon’s notable secrecy, there’s little point in looking to the company for help. But Laura Hazard Owen, writing for PaidContent.org, has rendered a masterful analysis drawn from a variety of sources, plus inference, intuition, educated guesswork and good old journalistic shoe leather.  
Owen’s conclusion? “Amazon Publishing hasn’t killed print yet.” Like its legacy publishing competitors, Amazon has won some, lost some, and broken even on some others."

**DEFINING SUCCESS IN PUBLISHING**

"Well, in an industry like traditional publishing where there was a loose monopoly, that industry could plod along for quite awhile. After all, book buyers have to buy something, and for hundreds of years that something had to be one of the products made by the small group of companies that controlled the market. Not true anymore. Now that industry has to contend with a major technological revolution that has increased competition and driven down prices virtually overnight. That’s where the publishing industry is right now, and things are going to get ugly before they get better. But everyone should keep in mind that all of this started a long time ago."

**COULD SERIALIZED FICTION BE THE FUTURE OF EBOOK PUBLISHING?**

"I think eBooks are the perfect low-cost vehicle for serialization, and it’s only a matter of time before someone does it big and the idea catches fire. As a reader, the thing I love most about serialized books and series in general, is that when you find a book you really enjoy, a world you want to see more of, characters you’ve come to know and love, or hate, you don’t want to leave.  
You want the story to keep going."
