**JEFF BEZOS OWNS THE WEB IN MORE WAYS THAN YOU THINK**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/ff_bezos_f.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=12750)"Apple is fundamentally a hardware company—91 percent of its revenue comes from sales of its coveted machines, compared to just 6 percent from iTunes. The iPad’s design, marketing, and product launches all emphasize the special character of the device itself, which the company views as a successor to the PC—complete with video-chat capabilities and word-processing software. Amazon, on the other hand, is a content-focused company—almost half of its revenue comes from sales of media like books, music, TV shows, and movies—and the fire-sale-priced Fire is designed to be primarily a passport to the large amount of that content that’s available digitally."

**WHAT THE "FREEMIUM" MODEL CAN TELL US ABOUT SELLING MORE EBOOKS**

"China’s market is unique in many ways, but instructive. Its “freemium” model has attracted notice, even though many have expressed doubt that it could work well here. Either way, it has a few lessons to offer. And one US writer is about to put them to the test in a way that seems likely to succeed."

**WHAT IS ABOUT BOOKS, REALLY?**

"That is the reason many are so disinclined to stop regarding paper books as ‘real books’ despite the advances of technology, social movements toward anything labeled ‘greener’ and the very real threat of younger generations growing up with all-digital libraries. It is not a thing so singular as ‘smell’, or ‘touch’ but it is rather the entire experience of opening printed paper pages,with no flash animation, video enhancements or any type of soundtrack–and yet still able to see a full realm billow out of this object, the details of which (if the writer knows their stuff) engage all of the senses, powered only by the brain. Books are literally the stuff dreams are made of, made tangible.
Can eBooks ever really capture that unique experience? As an eBook writer and proponent I can only say “I hope so.”"

**TEACHING PUBLISHING AS A 21ST CENTURY LITERACY**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/printingpress.600.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=12751)"One of the goals of education—digital or otherwise—is to prepare students for thinking and doing outside the classroom. And while it is true that the goal of teaching writing has always been to prepare students for writing beyond the walls of the schoolhouse, this is even more the case now that digital publishing has become so widely available in our society. In other words, as much as possible, the task of teaching writing is also teaching writing for public consumption, and teaching writing for public consumption in the network society means teaching writing and publishing as being inseparable."

**PISSING IN THE POOL (OR WHY READERS HATE INDIE WRITERS)**

"Let me put this as simply as I can:
If you are charging for your work, you have an obligation to be professional.
This is particularly true in the case of publishing. When you put your book up for sale on Amazon, you’re in direct competition with every other work of literature ever published, near enough. That means *you have to be that good*.
You don’t have to have written the single best book ever written, of course. But there has to be at least one person in the world, who doesn’t know you, for whom your book is the single best way they could spend their money and reading time."

**SEARCHING FOR THE FORMULA TO DELIVER ILLUSTRATED BOOKS AS EBOOKS**

"I want to make clear at the outset that this post is not about “enhanced ebooks”, making something multiple-media out of a book that started as straight text. That’s a “want to do” problem that I’ve always been skeptical about and which I believe many, if not most, publishers are abandoning as “not commercially viable at this time”. Today’s ruminations are about moving illustrated books from print to digital, which many of today’s book publishers will find a “must solve” problem as the channels to reach consumers effectively with illustrated books — the bookstores — are diminished in number and power by digital change."

**7 WAYS DIGITAL PUBLISHING CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE**

[![](http://www.40kbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/JoannaPenn.jpg)](http://www.40kbooks.com/?attachment_id=12752)"(4) Speed of publishing
It takes 24-48 hours for a new ebook to become widely available through the network of online ebookstores. For many traditional publishers, this journey takes 6-18 months and many print books are still not available as ebooks. Some lament this speed as they claim there is too much poor quality writing out there. But speed of publishing should not shortcut your editing, rewriting and beta reading process. That should all occur before you click Publish, but when you are ready, it only takes a few days to start selling. Fantastic!"
