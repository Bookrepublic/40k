  «As you may guess, this makes for some poignant scenes. But the authors also do a superb job at making you care about the characters and their relationship because they show that it means something to each of them. The themes that pervade the story carry weight. It's not just loneliness, but also a feeling of being loved and being needed. It helps that the story's straightforward prose whisks the story along. All of this conspires to give Benchwarmer an emotional strength that, while reminiscent of the Toy Story films, stands quite well on its own merits.»
