  «Imagine finding yourself in a desperate situation -perhaps even a matter of life or death- but you have no way to resolve the problem. Suddenly, as if sent from heaven, a Good Samaritan appears and says that he and his friends can help. All they require from you is a small monetary payment and a single object, a "keepsake", from your home. Would you refuse?
  

But once the job is completed, how would you react if the one object they take is the thing you treasure above all others -a family heirloom, your wedding pictures, or even a medal of honor?
  
  

"Keepsakes" by Mike Resnick kept me glued to my seat until the very end, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in science fiction. I loved the ironic twist at the end of the story and Gabe's determination to take down the Star Gypsies, even if it was the last thing he did. It made me wonder how I would really react if faced with a situation like this. Mike Resnick's easy-to-read style is quickly becoming one of my favorites, and I would recommend his books to any reader.»
