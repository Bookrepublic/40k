  «Pearlman's concept for "The Final Dream" is innovative, surreal, and disturbing. Not only does it seem completely plausible that our present world could move towards this future world, it's unnerving to consider that we might allow subscriptions to infiltrate the more personal moments of our lives (and 'Liking' it).
