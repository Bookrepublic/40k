  «I suggest to you that Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) neuroscience graduate student Livia has in "From Words to Brain" written a pretty good introduction to Linguistics as a field of study both formal or private. She quite specifically looks at language in terms of story.
  

She makes the point that reading a story literally affects us physically. We are naturally empathic creatures who truly do share the emotional lives of characters whose identity to us is that of squiggly spots on a page. What Blackburne adds to the discussion in this cleanly-written extended essay is some quite intriguing physical evidence of the specific effects writing has on the reader.
  

Very enjoyable, and 99 cents a download on Kindle, well worth the price.
  

And that's the final word.»
