  «The concept that someone could steal the sky and melt it down into liquid was fascinating to me. I didn't realize "the sky" meant the entire universe until the characters broke through the ceiling to find the Earth moon encased in it too. I realized how different our lives would become if we didn't have access to sunlight any more. One could only imagine that panic and chaos would ensue until people learned how to live in this new world.
  
  

I also found Sampietro Mischief's monster servant, Chives, hilarious. His constant grumbling about doing household chores and even his decision to create a duplicate Chives all made him a unique and humorous character.»
