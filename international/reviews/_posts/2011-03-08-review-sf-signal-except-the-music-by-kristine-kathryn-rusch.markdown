  «Except the Music reads like a mainstream piece of fiction; the fantastical element of the story is marvelously underplayed, making it accessible even to casual fantasy fans. Rusch's characterization of Max is lifelike, an important ingredient to any story, but even more so to one that is about one man's struggle to deal with his own future and past failures. It's themes like these that make Except the Music meaningful and one of those stories that initiate introspection.»
