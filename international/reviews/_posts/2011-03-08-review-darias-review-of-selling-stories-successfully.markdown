  «Marketing meets Literature. And it works. Stephen Brown, a proved expert about that mushup, amazes 40k's readers with an essay that shakes wannabe writers up. He is not so kind to purer-than-pure literati and shy authors: if you want to sell your book, and you do, you should be creative in storyselling as well as you are in storytelling. If many bestsellers' authors in the history of literature could have done so, you can. Not, you must, because it is easier and much more important in a digital contest.»
